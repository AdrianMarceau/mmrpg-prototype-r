Within the distance, protruding mountains suggest the expanse of an ever-broadening horizon. Nothing seems to be negatively affected here, and as such it's the ideal place for a training session. There are no Robot Masters who have made this place their domain, but as a result there's a bit of a rabid Met problem. While houses may fill the landscape, there's not a soul here to be found, suggesting an unnerving silence to a place of such life...",

Fortunately for him, in fact, as after being suddenly hijacked into the Prototype, it meant a familiar base of operations was just in sight. Unfortunately, however, it means overcoming the plethora of belligerent Mechas and hazardous terrain; Dr. Wily certainly must be cursing why he made his fortresses so difficult to infiltrate! Thankfully, training seems to be ideal here, so using this area may be beneficial to gain one\u2019s bearings.

His goal is his citadel in the distance, nestled safely within the reassuring mountainscape of his home country. And safety is exactly what he needs at the moment, as besides the obvious nipping frostbite, there\u2019s a sudden infestation of Mets in the area! Once he gains his footing however, the harsh climate and abundance of Mechas may prove bountiful in any efforts to grow stronger. For now though, securing his home is his best shot at making contact with Dr. Light, and hopefully discovering the circumstances that brought them into the Prototype in the first place\u2026",

Dr. Light's home is fiercely defended by the well-known hero Mega Man and his sister Roll, so the sheer idea of ever getting past such a reputable pair is downright foolhardy. But at heart, it's a home, not a battlefield; the sense of family is so strong that growth and recovery somehow seem to magnify within these walls. Light Laboratory hosts many of Mega Man's greatest friends and family beyond his sister and father, such as helpful companions like Rush, Tango, Eddie, Auto, Beat, and the dozens of Light-built Robot Masters. At the heart of it all though is Mega Man, Roll, and Dr. Light, and with their commitment to each other, it's no wonder how this family's stayed on top for so long.",

Bass is always on the frontline when it comes to action, though this time he's bitterly accompanied by Wily's newest evil creation, Disco. Absolute strength and domination is at the forefront of everyone's thoughts here, so the attacks are fiercer and victors prosper even greater. There's hundreds of malicious Robot Masters and Mechas that have been manufactured in these halls, but the one that seems to stick around the longest is Reggae, whose raison d'etre is to torment Dr. Wily's every waking minute. With an abundance of death traps, evil subservient machines, and Bass, Disco, and Dr. Wily at the center of it all, it's a wonder how Mega Man manages to bring this place to pieces every time.",

Proto Man may not have any happy feelings of nostalgia towards Cossack's Citadel, but it's his duty to defend the doctor from all threats if they wish to survive, alongside the Prototype's debug tool, Rhythm. Alongside Dr. Cossack and his Robot Masters is his daughter Kalinka, who actively ventured into the Prototype to offer background support and equipment to her father. The Cossacks may not be quite as prevalent in the public conscious like the Light family are, but that doesn't mean they're any less formidable a team.",

Cutter and Missile type abilities appear to do well on this field, but Wind and Swift type are at a great disadvantage.  Beware of the Flea robots, however, as they are very fast and deal long-range Impact type damage to your team. It is said that Metal Man occasionally visits this place to spy on Cut Man, but these reports are unconfirmed and largely speculation. Or at least, according to Metal Man.",

An uneasiness that was completely right, of course, when Bomb Man eventually took control under the orders of Dr. Wily. The supplies offer Explode robots many an advantage, but the city's design requires Impact and Freeze robots to hold back lest the whole place falls apart. Active landmines that were never discarded can pop out of pits, dealing severe damage to the unexpected. As a landmark to any explosion enthusiast, Napalm Man tends to visit often on his vacations.",

Obviously, Time-cored projectiles flow excellently here, even if the same cannot be said for Impact and Swift typed attacks. Flutter Flies feed off the temporal energy, and can emit highly irradiated tachyon blasts from their eyes. Flash Man regularly sneaks in to siphon energy for his own means, likely to gather surplus energy for his own Photon Collider field.",

The advent of advanced robotics now means Robot Masters like Oil Man can burden the risks that once threatened the lives of human workers, even if oil is ultimately falling out of favor versus the more practical solar energy. The overabundance of pollution strengthens Earth attacks, though this doesn't apply to Electric or Water attacks whatsoever. Take note of the Beetle Borg mechas; they assist in gathering soil samples for surveying, but as a result they're not well-suited for combat. Due to their age, the oil equipment has been known to sporadically break down, so Drill Man's always on speed dial when it comes to circumventing these performance issues.",

All these factors mean that Cutter and Electrical attacks have a much stronger influence here than normal, while missiles tend to falter often. The cold industrialized environment is definitely disheartening to those who spend long hours here, but funnily enough Wily's hostile takeover did have a positive; the lively Pierrobots, dancing on their mobile gears, adds a nice splash of color to the place! Cut Man tries to sneak in often to spy on his old nemesis, Metal Man, but his oversized headgear doesn't really lend itself well to stealth....",

Unsurprisingly, before the project could ever be put to use, Wily's Air Man took it over as a base of operations to wreak havoc on the poor cities below. The elevated altitudes certainly do well for Wind Robots, with it having the exact opposite effects on Earth and Time robots. The Fan Fiends that take residence on the platforms would be just about harmless anywhere else, but on a platform thousands of feet off the ground, one cannot take any risks on falling off. Tengu Man tends to be a frequent visitor to the Sky Ridge; apparently, he's quite fond of the architecture.",

There's no discernible reason why Dr. Wily would choose to attack it of all places, but it was an adept location for a specialist swimmer like Bubble Man. Likewise, it would have the same effect on most Water and Nature robots that choose to fight here. It's imperative one doesn't mistake the Snappers for actual crabs; they're Mechas that'll soak any trespassers who come too close for comfort. Hidden within the waterfall itself, you might actually get a glance of what appears to be Wave Man. As someone looking for solitude, it seems the last place anyone would bother to look would be behind a torrent of water.",

This technology proved intriguing to Wily's heinous scheme, so he sent his nimble right-hand man, Quick Man, to personally gift him its ownership. Thus, speed and lasers are of essence in grasping victory when it comes to battle. They're easy to miss, but Spring Heads travel across the ground to deliver surprising spring-powered headbutts. Top Man also occasionally spends time here when he's looking to challenge his dancing abilities by spinning around the deadly lasers. So much for future militarized combat.",

Explosives reign supreme here, and the piping of the tower renders other incendiaries like missiles and flames ineffective. Mention was made earlier to the Killer Bullet mechas, but it must be repeated; they'll cause as much damage to the structure as they do themselves, and a pipe station extending into the stratosphere is uncomfortably unstable as is. Not uncomfortable enough to ward off Bomb Man apparently, as an explosively rigged tower high up in the sky is seemingly his idea of a fun time.",

These abnormalities amplify time energy, but this comes at the cost of abating acceleration and light-based momentum. The Crazy Cannons are Wily's own design, positioned in tight corners where they'll bombard a target with cannon shots. Whenever Time Man notices an irregularity of his own tachyon count at the Clock Citadel, he'll immediately travel to the Photon Collider in an effort to confront Flash Man over his thieving.",

Bolstered by a strong natural environment, nature-based shields perform wonderfully, while any wind projectiles will at best disrupt a leaf here or there. The highly popular Battons only really monitor the plants and animals for the sake of species maintation, and going out of the way to actively destroy the bat-based Mechas isn't really worth the effort. Wood Man's formed an alliance with Snake Man to implant spying devices to elusively watch over the animals, though Snake Man's less interested in animal preservation than he is on wanting to snack on an endangered species...",

The hedgehog-like Needle Neds roll around and occasionally fire off piercing conical projectiles, and they look absolutely adorable doing so. The cargo nets have occasionally been known to get caught into tangled knots, so when they just can't be salvaged, Blade Man is usually called upon to simply slice the whole thing off -- he'd like to try to untangle them himself, but he doesn't quite have the hands for it.",

The themed Mag Flies have their own pull as well, a pull that becomes rather dangerous around bottomless pits -- though any experienced tactician would figure out using this to their advantage in traversing the Magnetic Generator. Magnet Man's currently working with Dive Man on designing a torpedo with magnetic attributes in the same vein as the Magnet Missile, but so far all the torpedoes come back to strike them instead...",

When the newly-mined Energy Elements were stolen by Light and Wily's line of robots, one of the marauders, Gemini Man, chose to retreat deep within the mine in a move to ambush Mega Man. A cunning move, as the flora strengthened both Crystal and Laser typed attacks. Three different elemental Nitrons survey the area, conducting aerial bombing raids to both destroy enemies and cull the growth of the mutated algae. There's been reports of Crystal Man making desperate attempts to bring some of the Reflection Chamber's flora with him; it's possible he believes that it'll somehow grant him clairvoyant powers?",

The rigidity of the rocks provide plenty of ammunition for Impact-based robots, and as a nice bonus does a decent job from protecting from all Cutter and Shadow typed projectiles too. Hanging off the ceilings of the caves down below are the Monkings, and it's quite easy to find yourself being swarmed by dozens of them at once. Beyond the mechas, Knight Man's been known to hang around the area as well. Since him and Hard Man share a similar code of honor, they've gotten to be close compatriots!",

This was disproven later down the line, but Top Man still feverishly enjoyed ransacking a place that always spun, even with all of the extra plantlife in the way. The extra spin should be of no problems to Swift typed robots, though it's best not to use any strong flame attacks in such a volatile, plant-friendly place.... Anyway, since they fit Top Man's theme, Dr. Wily also provided some repurposed Spin Fiends to provide Top Man a little extra firepower and labor. Of course, it's not easy to transport such heavy Mechas in such numerous amounts, so Charge Man is usually entrusted with the duty of getting them to and fro.",

The landscape's constantly shifting and there's many tight pathways to crawl through, evoking the spirit of Snake Man's own style of battle. His spirit carries through so much of this place, in fact, that it somehow powers up moves of his type while weakening the moves of his diametric foils, like Hard Man. Take note that the snake heads littered around the course aren't part of the decor: they're called Petit Snakeys, and they love to catch opponents off-guard with their camouflage. Snake Man's found himself at odds with Slash Man, whose ambition is to lay siege to the place and redecorate it in his own image. Naturally, he wants to call it the 'Slashy Columns'.",

The plant itself continued to run -- too well, in fact, as what were conductors, trash disposals, and hydraulic lifts quickly became glorified death traps. This increased static productivity does affect Electric and Swift robots positively, however, and that's not all when it comes to increased performance. The Elec'n, normally mere electrical substations, can plug into the plant's electrical supply to deliver lethal shocks. Maintaining such a large resource has proven difficult for the absent minded Spark Man, so the more attentive Fuse Man has substituted in from time to time.",

Lying low amongst the trash are the Ribbitrons, and they delight on hopping out and making the septic system an even less delightful time! The dark, catacombs-esque ambience has also always been a favorite of Skull Man's, but he's always been less enthralled about Shadow Man and the Ribbitron surprising him from dark corners whenever he shows up.",

If being perfectly lit were to be an art, this place would've been a masterpiece; fine-tuned by Bright Man himself, there's not a single place where darkness could hide. But, in the odd situation the lights in a specific room needed repairing, Bulb Blasters were sent in to guarantee the lighting remained in tip-top shape. Cossack also made sure to offer support areas for any suffering civilians lacking a home; for a lonesome wanderer like Dynamo Man, it's given him a place to stay on multiple occasions.",

The stormy conditions lend themselves well to electric attacks, while Flame robots can hardly get an ember started with the damp conditions. Robo Fishtots handle the maintenance of the sewage systems by 'chewing' trash and faulty pipes like kibble. The tiny bits they fail to clean, Pump Man works on to completely eradicate all the bacteria. It's not that he was necessarily asked to, but it makes him happy to make everything lemon-scented.",

Due to the intense tenebrosity, electrical switches were installed to illuminate the dark cave; not much electricity can be allocated elsewhere, however, so the excavation has to be left entirely to drilling robotics and explosives. Luckily, the Drill Moles can tunnel through solid bedrock with a fair amount of independent power. Robot Masters like Drill Man and Ground Man help out tremendously in this regard as well, but as they're not expendable, it's of the utmost importance they remain steadfast in their decision-making.",

The Pyre Flies aid Pharaoh Man by warding off graverobbers, and by providing him with direct-feed recording to spot intruders. With so much ancient history left still undiscovered within its depths, Pharaoh Man's called on the equally-knowledgeable Sword Man to discover and decipher its remaining secrets.",

As with any questions using the word 'somehow', the answer is a resounding no. What's going on here is that space is being artificially recreated in appearance only -- there's plenty of gravity and oxygen to be had here. The atmosphere still powers up Space-cored robots though, with it logically weakening Wind and Earth-core robots as well. When Ring Man had control of the place, he employed the Ring-Rings to further emphasize the illusion. With all of these elements in place, even robots who have been up in space can hardly tell the difference. Star Man, for example, has been routinely visiting and still hasn't figured it out.",

Since the junk gets compacted into cubes by automated pressers, it gave Dust Man plenty to work with in regards to his Dust Crusher. Hygienics are substantially below-average here however, so likewise Nature abilities end up falling below average as well. The Ladybug series of Bladers, known for their versatile aviation, have been assigned to the scrapheap, and can easily be spotted amongst the garbage by their strong primary color scheme. Due to being able to switch between propeller-based and jet-based flight, the Lady Bladers have become of great interest to Gyro Man.",

While this meant it was beyond use for humans, submersible robots like Dive Man continued to operate the base for restoration and combat efforts. There's plenty of ammo for Water and Missile-core robots here, but as all the platforms are composed of a metal alloy, Earth-core robots have almost no external power to rely on. Along with an assortment of mines and spikes that spilled out from the initial collapse, Manta Missiles patrol alongside the ship hulls to locate potential fuel leaks. Commando Man's been seen docking government-issue ships in this makeshift harbor as well, though he's very out of his element out in the sea.",

Skull Man enjoyed the macabre theme regardless, and felt it fitting to have this be the arena where he and the Blue Bomber could finally meet. Shadow and Explode typed robots showcase strong performances on this field, but the skeleton-based flooring seems to have an adverse effect on attacks relying on speed. The defensive Skullmet mechas tuck themselves away at the end of long corridors, spelling doom for any who find themselves cornered. There's been rumors floating around that Magic Man's been around here often, apparently looking to \"get his dinosaurs back.\"",

As a testament to the ever-evolving battle between Dr. Light and Dr. Wily, the museum became the focal point of Wily's mischief when he breached its walls to resurrect the formidable Guts Man. This hallowed hall is not just a place of remembrance, but also a reminder of the unending rivalry and the legacy of Mega Man.  In the world of the Prototype, the Robot Museum has taken on a new guardian in the form of Doc Robot. This multifaceted machine, capable of mimicking the abilities of other Robot Masters, has claimed the museum as his domain. With a deep-seated respect for the legacy of Robot Masters, Doc Robot sees himself as the protector of their memories and the curator of their histories. His presence transforms the museum from a mere showcase to a living testament, where the past meets the present in a dynamic dance of technology and tribute.",

The Royal Palace (also known as King's Castle) has been fully restored to it's pre-destruction glory here in The Prototype and consists of many floors each more perilous than the last, but the throne room at the very top is the lion's den where our inevitable fight will take place.  Decked-out with silky red curtains and chevrons, s gold-plated throne, a giant overhead computer, and a two pairs of capsules containing robot bodyguards waiting to jump into action at a moment's notice, King is not playing games with his new setup.  The purple brick walls and lavender pillars might confuse one into thinking this place was inviting, but anyone foolish enough to venture here will soon learn their mistake.",

Thus, it's a contamination of the entire system, emanating the source of whatever infliction has infiltrated the Prototype. In a last-ditch effort to defend itself, the mysterious contamination surprisingly replicates the strongest force currently available in the Prototype; the teams of the doctors! These hollow sigma copies have no reservations against using any and every advantage available on hand, so the doctors have to do the same to succeed and escape! Security Beaks are the primary mechas whose purpose is to root out any intruding malware, and as a source field in the Prototype, every single Mecha's data can be loaded and summoned on this field. With the hope of the world on their shoulders, this is the final destination and the final battle. Fight, our heroes, for everlasting peace!",
