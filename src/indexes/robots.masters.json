                "description2": "Before the world of Robot Masters, before the world of mechanical conflict, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were partners, pioneering the world of robotic technologies together. After a failed prototype, a single robot was created, who would serve to be the template for all robots afterward. This robot was named Rock, and was later followed by his sister Roll and the Robot Masters, a team of industrial humanoid robots designed to help humanity. However, Dr. Light\u2019s lab partner, Dr. Wily, was jealous of Light\u2019s critical acclaim and stole the Robot Masters, harming humanity instead of protecting it. When all hope seemed lost, Rock, with a strong sense of justice, volunteered to stop the rampaging robots himself and was upgraded to become Mega Man! With the Variable Weapons System, Mega Buster, and the hope of the world on his shoulders, he prevailed against Dr. Wily\u2019s malicious plans. However, Dr. Wily continued his work to make new plans and robots, even stealing other's work to benefit himself! However, each time has resulted in failure due to Mega Man\u2019s fight for justice. Mega Man hasn\u2019t done everything himself though. Drs. Light and Cossack have made various upgrades, including a slide, an explosive ball, and a charging blast ability, while also working on various other robots designed to help Mega Man\u2019s struggle, most notably his robodog Rush. He also gains support from mysterious allies, and from the various robotic denizens of the world. As long as Mega Man is in the fight, hope will never be lost!",

                "description2": "Dr. Wily, having experienced failure upon failure upon even more failure, concluded that perhaps his Robot Masters were too focused on one singular aspect, hence their piddling results against his nemesis. After going through Mega Man's schematics, he eventually decided to make a robot just as adaptable as Mega Man, the end result being Bass, the most recurring rival of the Blue Bomber. Bass is equipped with the rapid-fire Bass Buster, an accelerating dash, and the Variable Weapons System, just like Mega Man. He also generously uses the Super Adaptor technology he \"borrowed\" from Dr. Light, which allows him to fuse with Treble, his support mecha. Although Bass is a diamond in the roughs of Wily's forces, commanding him is nigh impossible! He\u2019s reckless and acts entirely on his own accord, leading him to go against Dr. Wily a multitude of times! Although one might suppose Bass is evil incarnate, he's aided many attempts to maintain world peace, stopping a robot revolution and a robot-influenza, illustrating that perhaps Bass isn't as cruel as he lets on. Even the galactic scale of justice robot, Duo, could feel a glimmer of it in Bass, even if that sense of justice is motivated entirely by self-interest. Like the tails to Mega Man's heads, they both strongly fight for what they believe in.... These beliefs just happen to conflict pretty often.",

                "description2": "Once the origin point for every bit of mechanical life today, Proto Man's now taken the mantle of being a renegade that stops villainy in the shadows. Proto Man has the Proto Buster, his trusty Proto Shield, the Variable Weapons System, and his trump card that redirects power directly from his nuclear core, the Proto Strike. Unfortunately, that outdated core is also Proto Man's greatest flaw; it's completely destabilized and acts as a ticker to his own life, for once that core breaks down, so will Proto Man. Proto Man's a resilient robot who seems to take pride in his lone wolf status, and despite his disconnection to the Light family, retains a sense of brotherhood with Mega Man as he assists the Blue Bomber. Proto Man's overall history is admittedly tragic and arduous, as he fled from his father figure, Dr. Light, to avoid repairs to his core and thus hang on to his identity. He roamed the world with only solitude and an impending end as his companions, eventually being manipulated by Dr. Wily to work under the guise of \"Break Man\" to properly spite Dr. Light once and for all. However, once it became apparent what Dr. Wily's true ambition was, he quickly turned on the doctor and saved Mega Man's life, forever cementing that he was neither Dr. Light's mistake nor Dr. Wily's weapon, instead finding his identity as his own independent robot, the Red Renegade Proto Man! Since then, he's worked to preserve world peace, and due to rescuing Kalinka and a sense of respect for Dr. Cossack, has recently found himself welcomed into the Cossack home. Despite showing some age, Proto Man's a great fighter among robots\u2014-and he's a good whistler, too!",

A pedestrian glance might find Roll too dainty to come as help, but she's got great gymnastic skill and can use common household items such as brooms and umbrellas to surprisingly devastatingly effects! However, Roll's main strength, befitting her supportive nature, specializes in techniques that benefit her friends and detriments her foes. Roll's often the most efficient and serene of the Light family, with a bit of an innocent schoolgirl tinge to her, but what's most notable is her persevering and admirable \"Go-get-'em!\" attitude. She's supportive and helpful in every sense she can be, and a friend to people, robots, animals, and mechas everywhere. Ever since she was infected by Dr. Wily's Roboenza virus, she felt responsible for worrying Mega Man and weakening his sense of focus, since then putting her efforts into having more of a presence outside of being the Light family's housekeeper. As such, she's intent on garnering the weight of everyone's hopes along with Mega Man, standing as courageously as her brother does on the battlefield! Not many know it, not even the other members of the Light family, but this was her dream all along....",

                "description2": "With his frustrations throughout the years, Dr. Wily could only ponder what it was about Dr. Light that allowed him to prevail each and every time: he created a parallel for both Mega Man and Rush in the form of Bass and Treble, yet they only served to be a thorn in his side. With each conclusion, Dr. Wily's mind was brought back to one scene; an infected Roll sacrificing her medicine for the sake of preserving Mega Man's well-being. He quickly realized he needed a robot who had that exact same sense of loyalty towards him, a parallel to Roll who can stand behind him for his world domination conquest-- A right-hand man...no, woman! Disco is an apprentice robot built by Dr. Wily to be his perfect analogue to Roll, for the sake of providing obedience and loyalty in ways that Bass never could. Opposite to the way Roll specializes in boost and support abilities, Disco specializes in break and assault abilities, lowering her targets' stats to dangerously low levels in short time and setting them up for a prompt defeat. Much like her brother robot's feelings toward Mega Man, Disco has a deeply rooted rivalry with Roll and will use any opportunity to flaunt her battle prowess in Roll's presence. It doesn't appear to bother her logic that she owes her entire conception to Roll, but believed superiority over their righteous counterparts seems to be a running theme with the Wily family, doesn't it?",

                "description2": "Rhythm is a digital support robot coded by Dr. Cossack and integrated directly into the data of the Prototype. Rhythm's initial function was to act as a kind of debug tool for the two doctors during the prototype's development, tweaking values and swapping parameters as needed, but recent events have forced Cossack to use her data to take on a direct combat role instead. As a genius hacker, Rhythm excels in abilities that modify the system from the inside to alter the conditions of battle in strange and unusual ways. Rhythm's a child prodigy, keeping a somewhat whimsical and carefree attitude interspersed with a love for complex equations and a massive intellect to match. Due to a lack of social interaction beforehand, Rhythm lacks a proper relationship with both Proto Man or any of the other Cossack numbers. Despite this, she continues to support them regardless for the sake of Dr. Cossack's well-being. She does secretly envy Roll and Disco though, as they get to wear the pretty casual clothes while she's stuck with a boring old combat uniform! With abilities that allow her to swap robot stats at will, Rhythm's a complete game-breaker for the world of Prototype; of course, only a child would lack the fairness to not cheat their way towards winning a game!",

However, those cutters happen to be his weapon of trade too, his signature technique being the \"Rolling Cutter\" where he throws his cutters at decently fast speeds! Cut Man also later developed the \"Rising Cutter\", an attack in which he releases a hilariously oversized pair of scissors to rise from the ground and sever enemies in twain. You'd expect someone working with such hazards to be pretty responsible, a honorable figure who takes every situation with a degree of maturity, but that certainly doesn't describe Cut Man. He's really just an overgrown child with a tendency to make horrible, horrible, horrible puns, puns most people wish he'd really just cut it out with. They thankfully don't always have to listen; Cut Man's a robot with a busy schedule, as requests for his help are sent from all over the world. And what exactly could one expect? Cut Man's function boils down to \"cut stuff\", so from hedge-trimming to hair-cutting to chopping lumber, he's got a lot of areas to cover.",

With the Super Arm modification he has, he can pick up a huge object many times heavier than himself and throw it like it was absolutely nothing. Give him something practically weightless in comparison to his strength, like maybe your average robot, and he can chuck it through a football field! Guts Man may be hot-tempered and stubborn, maybe overly stubborn, but deep inside it may be a surprise to hear he's a real softy. In fact, he loves Karaoke and tends to visit the local Karaoke bar almost every day after work, and it's been said his singing is almost indescribable, a sound no words could ever give justice to. But all of that happens after work; Guts Man never takes a break until his shift completely wraps up. At the end of the day however, he does really mean well, and despite his rough exterior and his muscles of steel, the guy's got a heart of gold.",

His Ice Slasher is a sharp piece of ice he form to freeze opponents, so cool it can stop a fiery opponent right in their tracks. His Ice Breath is also pretty impressive, releasing cold pieces of frost to immobilize his opponents. Ice Man's a pretty huge show-off, believing that he's the coolest robot out there, and the admiration from Freeze Man doesn\u2019t really hurt his ego. Ice Man loves having snow fights and he absolutely loves the winter season, but he hates getting remotely near a sauna, due to feeling stuffy in them. Although one might suppose Ice Man can\u2019t function well in hot environments, he performs averagely well in them, he simply just wouldn't want to be caught dead in them. He also has a bit of a crush on the acclaimed TV journalist Plum, but don't tell anyone! Ice Man's willingness to demonstrate how cool he is may just come from an inflated ego, but any of the fighters who might've tumbled with him could support that belief. Granted, they likely don't mean cool in the same way, but he'll take any chance he can get to show off.",

His Hyper Bomb is an explosive with a special material that allows it to blow up much larger than a regular explosive, but the Hyper Bomb suffers from this in the aspect of its weight limiting how far it could be thrown. Bomb Man circumvents this however, by bouncing through the air and simply dropping his bombs, catching his opponents below off-guard with a devastating aerial attack. He also has the much larger Danger Bomb, but the risk with this technique stays true to its namesake; it's pretty dangerous. He loves going to firework events and showcases, being infatuated with the beautiful combustion that resemble his own work. Bomb Man's an avid bowling player too, playing and rolling the ball with exceptional ease. One time, after forgetting to bring his bowling ball, he quickly improvised and used his own bombs as a makeshift ball, sparking the now-popular sport, Bomb Bowling. This obsession with bombs isn't exactly the safest hobby one can have, but Bomb Man happens to find the most fun in the things that aren't always the most safe for him.",

So, he went ahead and made Fire Man in order to burn it all until there was nothing left. Fire Man's Fire Storm ability can easily reach temperatures to over 7000 degrees, allowing him to focus in a stream of fire while using its excess energy to protect himself. He's even been able to hone in his fire production even further, creating the Fire Chaser technique. Fire Man's sense of justice is the most fiery thing about him though, strongly believing in what he calls the \"Flames of Justice\" and primarily why he created the Fire Chaser technique in the first place. Fire Man had a brief stint as a vigilante of the night, trying to round up villainy and stop it in its tracks, but this was short-lived as his flame would quickly give out where he was hiding in the middle of the night. In his off-time, he enjoys camping and relaxing in the summer, but gets rather down on rainy days. Fire Man was the first of a multitude of flame-based robots, but he hasn't been proved outdated yet; perhaps it's his strong belief in the Flames of Justice that keep him pressing forward.",

While his slender appearance may not seem like it suggested anything particularly robust, it was his control of electricity that shocked and amazed scientists throughout the globe. Elec Man was put to work in controlling any and all flow in surrounding electrical plants, but nothing compares to the output of his Thunder Beam, a spurt of electrical energy that can pierce through rock. It's a lot of energy to pull off though, so unless the circumstance is dire, Elec Man tends to stick with the less-demanding Thunder Strike ability. Elec Man boasts a razor-sharp judgement and leadership skills, a responsible robot for any Mecha to look up to, but when not leading, Elec Man oftentimes tends to be pretty self-concerned and thinks a little too highly of himself. He was also one of the first robots to give Mega Man a run for his money, his electrical strikes being able to easily pierce Mega Man's meager defenses. Elec Man's electrical control is absolutely astounding and still researched today, and despite the increasing plethora of electrical robots, Elec Man's still as impressive today as he was when he was when first created.",

The main problem was his confusing algorithm system that Dr. Light thought would make him too \u201cpowered up\u201d compared to other robots, so he thought he would temporarily shelve the project. Sometime not far after, Dr. Wily stole him and completed him, although not without some flaws and compromises. Time Man was originally supposed to be able to stop time completely for a few short seconds, but now he can only slow down time for a few seconds, something his successor was able to manage. To make up for this, Dr. Wily gave him the Time Arrow in order to make him more offensively viable. Time Man's all about being punctual, going so far that he even plans his day out the week before! He's awfully conceited however, and he doesn't tend to speak if he finds that a response would only waste his time. Time Man has found use as the top researcher at the Chronos Time-Space Institute and was instrumental in the creation of the \"Time Skipper\", but after Wily haphazardly used it, the research for it was utterly wasted. Time Man does annoy others with his schedule, but it appears that it does give him an awful lot of free time....The thing is though, he finds hobbies to be a waste of time, so if you don't have hobbies to enjoy your free time with, what's the point of being so punctual?",

It was too late for Dr. Wily to convert his energy source to solar nor did he really care, so Wily just figured Oil Man could stick with the oil energy source and he could just power himself. Oil Man utilizes the Oil Shooter, a buster attachment that allows him to create oil quickly to splat nearby enemies. This goes great with the Oil Slider on which he slides at high speeds to damage enemies head-on. Oil Man works at an oil refinery, where he pays constant attention to the oil production. He was never really obligated to work there, but Oil Man simply loves being a part of the process. He's got a very loose personality and prefers to do things at the last minute, much to the dismay of Time Man who he often accompanies himself with. Oil Man also has business connections with Flame Man, seeing as Flame Man's one of the few other robots who willingly power themselves with oil. He doesn't tend to get close to him however; he's well aware of what happens when oil and fire happen to cross paths.",

However, their similarities end there; Metal Man's Metal Blades are much more deadly than anything Cut Man's made, being razor-sharp discs that can be thrown for pinpoint accuracy. He's fond of using the environment to his advantage in order to overwhelm his opponents, switching between conveyor belt to conveyor belt before unleashing a barrage of Metal Blades. Metal Man's an efficient and determined worker, but fellow coworkers often have issues working with him due to his dry wit and untrustworthy tone. On his free time, he enjoys playing with flying discs in the park, for reasons that certainly shouldn't need any explanation. Although he may not display his emotions about it, Metal Man also gets incredibly flustered whenever someone mockingly calls him a dentist. Metal Man's an incredibly fierce opponent with a killer weapon, but it appears that his own armor isn't all that durable. Chances are it probably couldn't even endure his own Metal Blades!",

Air Man employs the wind to attack and push aside his enemies, generating powerful gusts and tornadoes with the propeller installed on his body. He can also pump wind through his body directly to his buster, allowing him to create a barrage of condensed wind he refers to as the Air Shooter. Despite having a fan for a mouth, Air Man can speak perfectly clear, and in fact speaks too much. He's often been referred to as condescending and had bored even the most stalwart of robots with his speeches. Most of the time, he grandiosely talks about his own feats and his fortitude as a fighter, claiming he believes there will never be a robot who could ever beat him. When he's not blowing hot air, Air Man enjoys wind surfing and playing the Japanese card game, Menko. Regardless of all his big talk, Air Man's winds are no laughing matter. They can completely blow away your expectations--and you as well!",

On land, it's a different story; he can basically only bounce around and make Dr. Wily erupt in laughter. Still, Bubble Man's gracefulness in water isn't any laughing matter, especially when he's using his Bubble Lead ability. While it may appear to be a harmless bubble, looks aren't everything; that bubble is actually made of pure lead and can completely wear away a robot's armor in a matter of seconds. He can also attack with a Bubble Spray, which is notable for being particularly conductive. Despite being the butt of about every joke in the robot community, Bubble Man's a affable individual who's interested in proving himself to the entire world. He's bad with budgets however, once spending away a large portion of Dr. Wily's Zenny for the sake of having the world's biggest bubble blower collection. Dr. Wily was not pleased. It's best to not make fun of him directly in front of his face, as while he may be a nice guy, his Bubble Lead's sent plenty of robots straight down to Davy Jones's locker.",

Comprised of light-weight materials, he's able to rapidly dash around and attack his opponent with nothing but his sheer velocity and his signature weapon, the Quick Boomerang. Quick Man's a confident and cunning robot, and while it may seem like he's always got a looming strategy up his sleeve, in actuality every action he makes is improvised and based all on effective quick thinking. At the same time, he's impulsive and impatient, and is willing to drop whatever he's doing to prove his worth in a race. Notably, when Quick Man was competing in the Battle and Chase competition, he forfeited his lead simply because he got bored and would've rather spent his time racing against Turbo Man, a fellow Robot Master rival of his. Quick Man's speed is absolutely phenomenal, and despite being one of Dr. Wily's first attempts of individually making a robot, Quick Man still serves to be one of the fastest robots in Wily's arsenal. However, because of his lightweight composition, his other capabilities suffer as a result. Still, it's hard to hit what you can't keep up with.",

While at first glance he may appear rather clumsy, Crash Man's adept at causing large-scale damage with all sorts of explosives, his favorite being his very own Crash Bomber. To be quite frank, Crash Man's likely to destroy stuff even if he isn't asked to. That being said, he's an obedient robot who's willing to help out Dr. Wily whenever needed .... If he's in a good mood, that is. While a majority of the time Crash Man can be docile, he can easily be thrown into a trigger-happy rage where he can end up causing thousands in property damage. Because of this, Dr. Wily tends to keep Crash Man on a short leash within a controllable environment. With his temper and his Crash Bomber, however, Crash Man is an invaluable asset on the battlefield, if only because chances are there'll be nothing left on it once he's finished. Now if only he could figure out how to pick things up with his hands....",

This short burst of temporal energy is referred to as the Flash Stopper, where Flash Man can mercilessly attack his adversaries while giving the appearance of phasing in and out of reality. Because he has to direct so much energy into his Flash Stopper though, his regular offensive capabilities are frankly unimpressive. Flash Man's been described with many saccharine adjectives such as \"contemptible\" and \"inconsiderate\", scoffing aside the considerations of others. Deep down though, Flash Man's actually quite nice and benevolent, a leader who cares deeply for the conditions of his subordinates. His aspirations are to be on the stage one day, an actor who loves having the spotlight on him whenever he performs. So far, he's only been given roles as an extra in films or plays --he did get an opportunity to star as a pitchman for a wig brand, but for whatever reason he turned the offer down in a furious rage. When he's bored, Flash Man loves using his time-stopping powers for his own devious motives, whether it be to play pranks on his fellow robots or to extend the amount of time he spends at his leisure. While it appears he's more interested on being on the stage rather than the battlefield, Flash Man's abilities are no act; it's the type of stuff Time Man wishes he could do.",

Combining both fierce flames with a fortified defensive armor, Heat Man's Atomic Fire is a flame that grows progressively stronger in succession, allowing Heat Man to take attacks head-on while dealing devastating damage. His armor's not without its flaws though, as oftentimes his lid will unintentionally close down on his own head. He's also able to enshroud himself in flames, where he can then launch himself to crash right into his targets. While Heat Man's a care-free individual and can carry out work at his own pace, he has difficulty dealing with deadlines. This leads to him quickly becoming unenthusiastic and nonchalant about his work, causing accidents that still do nothing to jolt his excitement for his occupation. Heat Man is known for his barbecuing expertise as well as being deathly afraid of ice cream, which is .... certainly a peculiar fear! With his intensive heat exceeding even that of Fire Man's, Heat Man's quite the improvement over his original counterpart. At least, mostly. His work just doesn't have the same heart and soul put into it, you know?",

Unfortunately, while the cypress is incredibly fortified and practically unbreakable, it's not exempt from natural deterioration nor damage from excessive heat, coupled with the fact that the cypress isn't really lightweight. To help try to circumvent that, Dr. Wily gave Wood Man the Leaf Shield, and while leaves don't really seem like they'd be a practical defensive item, Wood Man's actually using dulled pieces of leaf-shaped Ceratanium to protect himself. He's a nature fanatic, often heading out on hiking and mountaineering trips, and even serving as a park guide from time to time despite his criminal record as one of Dr. Wily's robots. Naturally, since he's so fond of nature's beauty, Wood Man's also fond of breaking the backs of anyone so daring to disrespect it, easily offended at the sight of the nearest litterer. Despite this, Wood Man is usually quite kind to both his colleagues and to the animal Mechas of Wily's forces, and holds environmental meetings along with Wave Man for the Wily robots to attend. He's a kind naturalist and a fortified warrior, and although skeptics may be stumped by his hinoki design, it helps to keep him closer to the beautiful world he loves.....

Light and Wily to be able to pierce bedrock for mining, Needle Man was based on Air Man's build and sacrifices traditional hands for the sake of his rapid-firing Needle Cannon. His jumping prowess is quite impressive and can provide enough force to keep him suspended in the air, which is where he can surprise opponents with his quick barrage of needles. That's not all he has in his pointy repertoire though, as he can toss the needles on his head for short-range combat, a somewhat straightforward tactic but it's his way of continuing to surprise his opponents. Needle Man's somewhat of a well-read individual and an intellectual, but this is coupled with his dry wit and his sarcastic tone of speaking, making him a difficult robot to get a read on. His hobbies include knitting and sewing, and he's always quick to make people known of the distinction between the two, but ironically enough Needle Man's deathly afraid of injections, shots, and just about anything medical that goes hand-in-hand with needles. Of course, Needle Man's a robot in the first place, so as far as fears go, his are as irrational as they come. Granted, it's not his concerns that matter in battle, it's his opponents; when he's unleashing a barrage of piercing needles, any opponents or clumsy teammates should be wary of becoming a veritable robot shish kebab.",

Of course, as with anything with Wily's name on it, he was promptly utilized in matters most nefarious. He can specifically launch the aptly-named \"Magnet Missiles\" to close and home in on any robot, guaranteeing utmost precision with the usage of ferromagnetic wavelengths! And, to further cement his distance-controlling tactics and strategies, Magnet Man's also capable of acting as a functioning magnetic generator, drawing in attracted adversaries to annihilate them in a brief barrage of close-combat firing. All in all, Magnet Man is an avant-garde aficionado when it comes to the turmoils of war, the utter epitome of a forward-thinking tactician and a remarkable leader. Yet, he is rather abrasive and without a commander like Dr. Wily to order him on, he does lack a sense of direction. Also, even though he's a robot, Magnet Man's been suffering from stiffness in his joints lately, so he's been scheduling weekly appointments with a proper chiropractor, specifically dealing in magnetic therapy and massages! Moving beyond Magnet Man's medical history, he's a phenomenal tactician with an admirable sense of seriousness!... But, it is awfully hard to take him seriously with the goofy magnet on his head, isn't it?",

That's Gemini Man's modus operandi, a robot co-designed by both Drs. Light and Wily to ward off any potential smugglers from their energy mining efforts. As subtly aforementioned, Gemini Man has the special capability of forming holographic imitations of himself to confuse and overwhelm his opposition, but that's not his sole gimmick; he's capable of also spouting off the Gemini Laser, a high-piercing beam of light that refracts off surfaces to specifically overwhelm opponents through surprise. He's a tricky man of mystery, but not without his fair share of personality quirks. His most notable issue is his overwhelming narcissism; really, a narcissism that goes beyond the regular definition and into a borderline obsession. An appropriate obsession though, seeing the whole nature of his replication technique and everything. Still, not an entirely healthy obsession... Anyway, moving on, Gemini Man's still a robot willing to put everything on the line for his comrades and brethren, making him an incredibly reliable robot on the field. But, for those who find themselves battling against Gemini Man: might be worth double-checking that you're fighting the real guy, yeah?",

Now that you're aware of this, that should make Hard Man all the more imposing when it's revealed his body is almost entirely composed out of the stuff! With his Ceratanium composition, his body is nigh invincible and impervious to damage, and to say nothing about how he hits with that armor! While that does form an inherent flaw in his mobility, Dr. Wily managed to cleverly circumvent his range issue with the Hard Knuckle weapon, where Hard Man's fists are actually rocket-propelled off his body to strike his opposition from afar. It's a dastardly tactic, but it's weighed out by the fact that Hard Man himself is a rather fair-minded and honest individual. While admittedly somewhat of a lazy bones, his primary battle tactic is to always ensure that he and his opponent are on equal ground, obviously before the inevitable result where he humiliatingly crushes his foe in fair combat. However, this mindset puts the forthright giant at odds with the more pragmatic Snake Man. Aside from his work, Hard Man's main hobby is Sumo Wrestling, and he has a fear of water after being pushed into a swimming pool by Snake Man. Those two are just never gonna get along...",

To be entirely honest, a robot who spins doesn't seem entirely useful for mining alien compounds, but nor does it really matter; Top Man went on to face Mega Man in combat using his dizzying Top Spin attack. This technique causes Top Man to sprout out miniature tops, and while on initial impact it's admittedly weak, its strength comes from the tops hitting continuously to stack up damage. And while one can easily surmise this themselves, Top Man's also capable of spinning his body rapidly (although only for his own amusement; it's awfully ineffective at actually hitting people!) As for his personality, Top Man specializes in making arrangements on Dr. Wily's behalf, being somewhat of a smooth talker. However, his character is most brilliantly displayed through his actions-- specifically, the action of dance! A superb dancer known for pushing his luck, he moves gracefully and smoothly, with his absolute favorite being Ballroom Dance. Alas, while he initially had dreams of stardom in his youth, reality slowly crept in and faded his hopes, Top Man now settling for being a dance instructor in his free time. Kinda makes all that spinning sadder when it's all a facade for his crushed dreams, huh?",

Unfortunately, Snake Man himself wasn't too fond of his occupation, and thus gladly took on the proposition to make Mega Man his prey! It's with this hunter mindset that Snake Man's battle tactics are entirely spun off of, utilizing and relying on ambush techniques in order to use the element of surprise to completely overwhelm opponents. And while Snake Man doesn't have any weapons that rely completely on force, he keeps track of prey through the usage of camouflaged miniature snakes, dubbed the \"Search Snakes.\" Fitting with his snake-ish appearance, Snake Man's vile and deceptive, a sneaky creature that revels in the cornering of all prey! This has led to multiple moral clashes between him and the mighty giant, Hard Man, whose beliefs in a fair and just battle naturally counter Snake Man's more behind-the-scenes mindset. Not everyone is Snake Man's enemy however, as he's known to find his comfort with his buddy, Toad Man; reportedly, this feeling is not mutual. Tenacity to a foul mindset, much like venom to a forked tongue, is a much too dangerous concoction to ever exist. Sadly, Snake Man's that exact dangerous mix!",

By all means, Spark Man would be an obvious improvement over Elec Man-- that is, save for one itsy-bitsy oversight Drs. Light and Wily failed to account for. Spark Man's way too scatterbrained to have the focus to produce that much energy! As a result, Spark Man's signature \"Spark Shot\" attack-- which was calculated to be more offensively viable than the Thunder Beam-- instead only completely paralyzes the target instead. Despite not living up to his electrical potential, Spark Man doesn't really seem to care; he is awfully scatter-brained after all! Rather than sparking a war, he's more suited towards finding sparks of friendship, willing to befriend any robot no matter their threat or intimidation level. And his favorite place to take his friends? The \"Seaside Town Aquarium\", home to a myriad of different forms of sea-life, with his obvious favorite being the electric eel. Naturally, Spark Man's pleas of saccharine friendship quickly gets on the nerves of his teammates, but it's a burden they often have to tough out; while those needles aren't offensively viable, they're great in patch-ups and repairs! However, Needle Man seems to be deathly afraid of being friends with Spark Man.... But that doesn't stop Spark Man!",

Rumors have circulated that Shadow Man is of extraterrestrial origin, stemming from his inexplicable background and the fact that his trademark weapon, the Shadow Blade, is entirely coated with some sort of substance not of this world. Oddly enough, despite the possible alien background, Shadow Man's somehow an expert in Earth-based ninjutsu techniques, able to perform basic illusory tricks, transformations into objects like logs, and summoning frogs.... All taken together, it's incredibly weird, but perhaps that's part of the mystery? Regardless, he's been often described as having a shallow mindset, and impulsive in nature. Above all else, Shadow Man seeks to uphold the honorifics of his class, with an intensive knack and interest towards capturing the surprise of both his enemies and allies. Naturally, following the ninja way, Shadow Man is easily one of the most dedicated robots to Dr. Wily's cause and ideals. So much so, in fact, that Shadow Man began illustrating and writing his own manga, \"Shadow Man Megamix\", in his free time to provide further funding to Dr. Wily's resources! An extraterrestrial start, ninja gimmicks, a penchant for surprise, a manga author... Shadow Man's one mysterious robot.",

Bright Man was Dr. Cossack's prefatory work, with the prime purpose of aiding expeditions by always keeping their environment well-lighted and accounted for. However, as all robots typically must in a world ridden with mechanical dysfunction, Bright Man had to eventually be modified for use in combat, much to Dr. Cossack's chagrin. Yet, Bright Man's means of attack are nontraditional; instead of a physical object, Bright Man overrides his lighting to over ten million watts, causing any nearby robots' preemptive safety measures to override their systems and temporarily shut down their movement. To put things into perspective, ten million watts can temporarily sustain a small to mid-average warship cruiser (as one may imagine, Bright Man is an energy-conserving nightmare!) Even brighter than his flash, however, is his mind, as Bright Man has multiple credentials to his name! In fact, Dr. Cossack was able to arrange Bright Man a position at the nationally-acclaimed \"Stravinsky Science Academy\", although ultimately he was fired for keeping his students after class for a grueling hour to listen to his various anecdotes. Nonetheless, out of the classroom and in the battlefield, Bright Man tends to be somewhat of a pacifistic coward, but a coward that holds it above all else to help his allies! Just, maybe only if all the stronger robots don't show up that day...",

Now, in all fairness, beyond his amphibian physique, Toad Man fulfills his agricultural purpose with the utmost efficiency, due to his Rain Flush equipment. He begins by rocketing a pod of vapor into the sky, which evidently forms into a shower of rain drops to assuage crop droughts; in times of combat, he utilizes acidic rain instead, benign to humans yet absolutely devastating for any robot's armor. Of course, as a toad-themed robot, his jumping prowess is something to behold, and has earned a long-jumping position in Russia's Robot Olympics team. Toad Man has also furthered his agricultural dedication by researching and experimenting with natural sciences, but most of all he has a fond appreciation of all types of music! ...Of course, his appreciation is unknowingly hindered due to the fact he's tone-deaf! But, even with his poor hearing, Toad Man's an absolute crowd controller on the battlefield, keeping waves of threatening robots away with his killer Rain Flush. Well, that, or maybe no one wants to get near that weird, slimy frog-skin of his...?",

Chalk it up to Dr. Cossack for not being much with visual pizzazz, but chances are Drill Man doesn't mind either way! As one would expect from his namesake, Drill Man's profession lies in drilling through the most dense of minerals, a complete aficionado when it comes to barraging the ground to its basics! And when austere drilling doesn't get the job done, Drill Man cuts to the chase by simply blowing up the job to itty-bitty little smithereens, bypassing both nature and safety limitations! These methods mirror the traits of their master, as Drill Man is as haphazard as they come. Calculations and planning ahead are nothing more than affirmations for his surely-always-correct gut feeling, so why bother with all the honorifics when you can get the job done in record time? Yes, this has worked out for Drill Man multiple times in the past, as he was lauded for his keen and nimble work in finding a long-forgotten gold mine! But, on the other end of the spectrum, Drill Man's hasty work ended up sinking most of his company's equipment and buildings. Whoops.",

Besides an astute sense of trap analysis, Pharaoh Man can, much like his brother unit Bright Man, light paths ahead of him using condensed solar energy. Likewise, he's able to launch the solar energy, henceforth referred to as the \"Pharaoh Shot\", in an offensive manner whenever he's stuck in a pinch! As his appearance would suggest, Pharaoh Man is a born leader, carrying an exemplary sense of verbosity, grandiosity, and gravitas! Eventually, Pharaoh Man swiftly began to take charge of the expeditions he was placed on, ultimately not requiring the assistance of human coworkers and commanding over 1000 different mechas! As this commendable description illustrates, Pharaoh Man appears to be a robot without a flaw to be had.... that is, he would be! However, for as grand as Pharaoh Man is, he transforms into a timid whelp the instant he sees a beautiful woman! The 1000-mecha army, the leadership skills, the grand demeanor doesn't mean anything if you can make Pharaoh Man blush!",

That may be the case, but pacifistic as he is, Dr. Cossack designed the robot Ring Man to break combat traditions and constrain opponents instead, with the usage of his signature palliative rings. Don't let that fool you, though; that ring still packs a punch! Especially when Ring Man effortlessly hurdles the ring, just before surprising the opponent as his ring boomerangs right back to him! Surprise is essential to Ring Man's fighting style after all, as he's a strategist and tactician that takes any logical opportunity to catch an enemy by their backs. Unfortunately, as a result, he's somewhat smug in attitude and unwilling to show mercy, no matter how deserved, towards his defeated foes. He's a letter-of-the-law individual, which needs to be pointed out as Ring Man's a member of Interpol, facilitating international police efforts and working alongside local policemen and federal agents alike. When he's not busy kicking crime by the proverbial heinie, he's known to be quite affluent in quoits (for the uninitiated, a ring-tossed game), and, barring his adorable princess Kalinka Cossack, has a pungent dislike of kids, toddlers and teens. A combat robot meant to detain rather than fight, Ring Man's an awfully admirable guy. He'd probably make a great best man at a wedding, too!",

While a robot made for cleaning servitude is rather archaic and certainly raises a robot rights question, Dust Man wouldn't be the one asking, as he's dedicated to cleaning up every corpuscle of trash he can! His suction is extremely powerful, albeit Dust Man's overeager attitude often causes him to be inundated with debris and dust. With his eye on the malicious, Dr. Wily quickly took note of this flaw, and much to Cossack's protest, outfitted Dust Man with an ability to launch extra volatile stage debris from his vacuum, henceforth christened the \"Dust Crusher\". An eager sanitation robot, Dust Man's all for spring cleaning, but as aforementioned, he does tend to overestimate his suction. As a result of this, he has somewhat poor confidence in his own capabilities. Other things of notice is that he's often been known to have a severe case of bad breath, as well as a vehement fear of all sorts of rodents. As an asset in battle, Dust Man's surprisingly an unexpected threat, as while other robots can throw fireballs and flip gravity, Dust Man's suction and exhaling has a simple effectiveness and strength to it. And, free of charge, he'll clean up any messes on the battlefield afterwards!",

Dr. Cossack was inspired to create Dive Man after reminiscing off of the old nationalist tales of his youth, about daring sea and submarine captains with an impeccable sense of drive towards serving the greater good. Dive Man encapsulates all these qualities, although he's really more of a submarine than a proper submarine captain; he's outfitted with homing torpedoes able to be burst out of his chest. And, due to a serendipitous design flaw, Dive Man can launch HIMSELF rapidly and dizzying, his go-to surprise attack when all else fails. It's important to emphasize that's entirely a last-resort move: not because of any massive stamina drain, but rather Dive Man occasionally suffers from an extreme case of motion sickness. Regardless, much like Cossack intended, Dive Man is the ideal sea captain, a figure who's trust-worthy, noble, an eager listener, and the utter epitome of a navy man. These attracting qualities put him at odds with his maritime foil, Pirate Man. But, whether he's friend or foe, Dive Man is nothing short of respectable. Just don't let him get too seasick, okay? Robot vomit is probably kind of gross.",

Thus, in contrast to the functional designs of his other robots, Skull Man's entirely centered around nothing short of pure combat, being the culmination of Cossack's technical knowledge while embodying nothing of his ideals. His strikes are tuned to be precise and killer, yet he can guarantee absolute invulnerability with his Skull Barrier, generating nightmarish skulls for an unexpected defense. Coupled with this is his strategic mindset; it's said Skull Man would willingly stand still indefinitely until his opponent made the first movement. However, being 100% combat at all times... has proven to be an issue in a restoration lifestyle. Skull Man has no sense of purpose nor social affability, and so has resigned himself to a lonely existence. He revels alone in the macabre, and watches horror movies all by his lonesome... At least, he did, until he found out Kalinka was also a fervent fan of horror as well! Still, with such a tragic and destitute background, it's hard not to feel bad for the guy....

Dr. Wily could have easily outshined Light with his pioneering of gravity distortion technology, but instead he made a robot out of it. At least Gravity Man puts it to good use! He likes to keep him and his opponent on separate planes to disrupt their strategies. However, this tactic is about all he has going for him in combat. Gravity Man is more interested in furthering the field of gravitational studies with his revolutionary research. Unfortunately, this involves confronting a lot of skeptics. A group of scientists once claimed the gravity shtick was a parlor trick done with superconducting magnets. Gravity Man responded by tossing a Redwood into their institute. He might seem a little distant, but maybe a reminder of space\u2019s vast gravitational pulls will bring him back down to Earth. Gravity Man could use some grounding.",

For starters, he can move effectively both on the land and in the water! Equipped with the Water Wave, Wave Man pumps water into the ground, causing geysers to erupt from random spots when the pressure reaches a breaking point. While good as a crowd control move, the attack lacks precision, so Wave Man is also equipped with a Harpoon cannon. However, even when used in tandem, this combination can\u2019t defend Wave Man from close-range combat. Working on the ocean floor, it is rare Wave Man would meet anything with consciousness, and his propensity for long range combat means he consciously avoids any form of contact. It\u2019s probably this lack of social interaction that\u2019s makes him so moody. Wave Man alternates between contemplative loneliness, miserable sorrow, and violent rages. These mood swings mostly happen at random, the only consistent trigger being pollution. Encountering aquatic contaminants, especially sludge, will throw Wave Man into a tantrum. Trying to use sludge against him probably isn\u2019t worth the risk, as it\u2019s easier to deal with a nervous Wave Man than an angry one.",

                "description2": "Dr. Wily has created Robot Masters faster than the speed of sound, capable of stopping time, and hotter than the surface of the sun, and for his most diabolical scheme yet, Wily will finally destroy Mega Man once and for all\u2026 by hitting him with a rock. Well, a lot of rocks to be precise. Stone Man is as imposing as he looks, destroying enemy robots with all the resilience of a brick wall. Using the Power Stone, Stone Man orbits large rocks around the battlefield, limiting his opponent\u2019s movement, leaving them open for strong physical blows. Stone Man\u2019s bricks are near impossible to scratch, let alone destroy, making them individually incredibly durable. Trying to hold them all together, however, is another story. This might seem like a weakness, but Stone Man uses this trait to his advantage, rolling with his opponent\u2019s punches by crumbling and reforming to brace attacks. Stone Man has grown quite accustomed to throwing his weight around, knowing he can get up again if he gets knocked down. It\u2019s this persistence that led Stone Man to form a strong friendship with Guts Man, having finally found someone he can pal around with without one of them accidentally destroying the other. Unfortunately, Guts Man does not share the enthusiasm Stone Man has for film, but they still find their common ground, hanging out in oil bars. Until they get kicked out for roughhousing, anyways.",

Dr. Wily intended to create an airborne Robot Master using a new theoretical form of rocket propulsion, but when it failed to come to fruition, Wily decided to cut his losses and attached a propeller to the unfinished Robot Master. Gyro Man doesn\u2019t seem to mind though, using his propellers to their fullest in both mobility and combat. In the air, Gyro Man is uncontested, and he knows it. Gyro Man will belittle his opponents (and sometimes allies) from the safety of the skies, sometimes tauntingly diving down just out of reach. You might think he\u2019s all bark and no bite, but Gyro Man can back up his aerial bombardment of jeers with the Gyro Attack. A speeding rotating blade is hard enough to deal with, but Gyro Man\u2019s ability to remotely redirect the attack allows him to hit the most evasive foes. Few Robot Masters have bested Gyro Man on the battlefield, and even fewer still have done so while also earning his respect, the sore loser decrying techniques like gravity distortion as \u201ccheap tricks.\u201d Ironically, those who have met Gyro Man\u2019s standards, like Quick Man and Tengu Man, ended up treating Gyro Man with the same contempt he treats so many others with. Why are all the fast Robot Masters such egomaniacs?",

Intended to maintain an abandoned space station, Star Man was designed to work under variable gravity fields. Space Debris has become exponentially more common in the year 20XX, so Dr. Wily also outfitted Star Man with the Star Crash so that he could protect himself, a defensive weapon not unlike those of Skull Man or Wood Man. Star Man has anything but a shielded personality, though. A romanticist deeply in love with the thespian arts, Star Man has found great success in film, much to the chagrin of Flash Man. You\u2019d think it was all the time control and gravity distortion technology that drained Dr. Wily\u2019s wallet, but it was actually the costs of Star Man\u2019s early filmography that exhausted his bank account. Dr. Wily had to focus so heavily on saving money in Gyro and Crystal Man\u2019s designs just to fund the special effects of Star Man\u2019s first space opera! Star Man\u2019s sentimental personality annoys his more pragmatic minded brethren, isolating the intergalactic Robot Master even further. It\u2019s lonely out in space, and despite his constant requests, Dr. Wily has yet to make a companion for Star Man. Poor Star Man seems doomed to burn out his fuse up there all alone\u2026.",

                "description2": "Arriving right on time on the battlefield is Charge Man, a Robot Master created by Dr. Wily to resemble a train. Well, maybe calling it a resemblance sells Charge Man short: he also functions like a steam locomotive, requiring coal and water to run. While this archaic energy system is hard to maintain, the energy production is incredible, allowing Charge Man to ram into foes with all the force of a derailed train. For enemies that call for ranged attacks, Charge Man can simply shoot out the very flaming coal that powers him. That stuff burns hot, so getting hit by it will hurt a lot! The Charge Kick is usually all he needs though, because if he gets enough momentum going, nothing is stopping him from running you down. This one-track battle tactic and his nostalgic design aren\u2019t the only things old fashioned about him. Hard working and honest, yet stubborn and neophobic, Charge Man is a real old chunk of coal. He\u2019ll bemoan the loss of the \u201cgood ol\u2019 days\u201d and how much simpler things were, even though the artificial intelligence that gives him life is a distinctly 20XX advancement. Funny he\u2019s brothers with the Gravity Distortion and Space Exploration Robot Masters then. At least he gets along with Gyro Man, the two of them both taking pride in their respective antiquated technologies. Just don\u2019t ask who\u2019s faster; their feud will last for days.",

His intimidating appearance scares most away, but in truth, Napalm Man is no warmonger. He is fiercely loyal and personable to those he gets close to and his love for weaponry comes across more like a nerdy hobby than a blood-- er, oil lust. No, Napalm loves weaponry and identifies it as a true art form, preserving that he deems beautiful. Maybe that\u2019s why he once blew up his own weapons museum; art is fleeting!",

To fund his future world domination endeavors, Dr. Wily created Crystal Man. Using hydrothermal synthesis, Crystal Man can grow crystals by altering the atomic lattice of minerals using intense heat and high vapor pressures. Crystal Man was able to sell these crystals to laboratories for a while, but once the word got out on who his creator was, customers grew suspicious and the cash flow ceased. Not one to let a Robot Master become obsolete, Dr. Wily decided to repurpose Crystal Man into a combat robot. Crystal Man can form the Crystal Eye, a large gemstone designed to splinter apart upon contact, sending sharp debris across the battlefield. In addition, Crystal Man can use the Crystal Mind, a trick he picked up in his side endeavors that enables him to heighten his senses. Crystal Man proved to be effective in this new role, but felt unfulfilled, not meeting his initially programmed goal of making dough. He started fortune telling on the side, specifically to stick it to the scientists he no longer worked with. His gemstones were genuinely high quality, and if they couldn\u2019t appreciate that, he would dedicate his schemes to upending people\u2019s faith in those self-righteous hacks!",

Unsurprisingly, being surrounded by nothing but ice and snow can get pretty boring, and soon Blizzard Man longed for greener pastures, both metaphorically and literally. Using his Antarctic exploration skills, Blizzard Man tried competitive skiing, which he quickly found success in. This Canuck has gotten three golden metals in the Robot Olympics for skiing\u2026 in a row! He discovered a true passion for all aspects of competitive events, including sportscasting various winter sports and helping to set up the snowy slopes in warmer climates. Blizzard Man does so by using the artificial snow maker he received in exchange for his meteorological equipment, which incidentally allows him to create the deadly Blizzard Attack, a flurry of sharp ice crystals he can fire at his opponents. It is this move that got Blizzard Man entered as a contestant in the First Annual Robot Master Tournament in the first place, as he was originally attending to commentate! After a quick failed stint being reprogrammed and helping Dr. Wi- er, Mr. X, take over the world, Blizzard Man settled down as a weather forecaster, combining his meteorological work and his commentating abilities. Don\u2019t count Blizzard Man out yet though; dashing through snow and enemies alike, Blizzard Man is sure to outcompete his opponents on the battlefield.",

That might sound like overkill, but this museum held some of the most historically significant artifacts in all of Europe, so the imposing figure of the eight-foot Robot Master was deemed appropriate. If his stature wasn\u2019t enough to give troublemakers pause, Centaur Man could use the Centaur Flash, creating a dimensional distortion to stop his targets in their tracks. The technique causes no direct harm to its quarry, but its combat potential was obvious to Centaur Man, which is why he decided to enlist in the First Annual Robot Master Tournament, exercising his otherwise dormant competitive nature. He performed well by using carefully premeditated strategies, but ultimately fell to Mega Man. This skirmish revealed the insane power of the Centaur Flash to the rest of the world, so Centaur Man was pressured out of combat by the international robotics community. The dejected Robot Master had to seek other forms of competition, and ultimately settled on losing all his zenny in the casino. You\u2019d think someone as thoughtful as Centaur Man would choose a pastime more virtuous than gambling, or at the very least one he was better at. Alas, Centaur Man bombs at the poker and blackjack tables alike, his horns giving away any attempt at a poker face. At least he seems to have a good track record betting on the ponies.",

However, when making a robot master who works under the smoke-filled skies of an oil-fired power plant, it makes more sense to indulge in some of that fuel, doesn\u2019t it? This was the philosophy behind Flame Man, and the project achieved great success\u2026 ignoring the fact he needs to fill up three times a day. Flame Man doesn\u2019t seem to mind, having been influenced by this strict time limit to embrace punctuality and discipline. His self-maintenance is meticulous, always taking scrupulous care of his oil reserves and facial hair alike. Flame Man quickly proved himself to be an effective worker, and this dedication won him the Saudi Arabian nomination for the First Annual Robot Master Tournament. Flame Man can channel the intense heat of his power production to fire off small flames from his buster. This attack has minimal cost on his supply of oil, but in serious combat, Flame Man can exhaust it further by unleashing the deadly Flame Blast, a pillar of flame that can erupt from any surface. Flame Man demonstrated this arsenal to great effect\u2026 until being reprogrammed and forced to fight Mega Man. This dealt a major blow to his pride, and the only way he could gain back his confidence was to take even more painstaking care of his mustache. In the days directly following the tournament, he\u2019d do nothing but refine his mustache between oil refills!",

                "description2": "Robot Masters\u2019 combat abilities are usually designed to serve a specific role, whether that be self-defense or world domination. Knight Man is an exception; is combat itself not a worthy goal? Based on the knights of medieval history, Knight Man\u2019s most noticeable feature is his incredible defense. Knight Man\u2019s resilient armor can shrug off most minor hits, but the shield he carries makes him nearly impenetrable. He\u2019s like a fortress on legs! Well, his armor is pretty heavy, so those legs aren\u2019t winning him any races. Fortunately, Knight Man doesn\u2019t need to worry about mobility when he wields impressive range and power. The Knight Crush is a deadly flail with a deceptively long chain, using its huge mass to plow through foes. Knight Man has used his mighty mace to smash through tons of robots, once reportedly defeating 1000 in a row\u2026 granted, it\u2019s not clear if these were 1000 Robot Masters, or a bunch of Mets and Tellies. Either way, this hefty repertoire easily won Knight Man the United Kingdom nomination for the First Annual Robot Master Tournament, which was promptly upended by Mr. X\u2019s evil scheme. Knight Man may be chivalrous, but Mr. X probably could have convinced Knight Man to willingly work for him, if only to get the chance to duel the famous Blue Bomber. Regardless, Mega Man bested the legendary warrior in combat, so with a win streak in ruins, Knight Man has appeared in the Prototype to do what he does best: fight!",

If you actually believed that, you clearly haven\u2019t seen Plant Man, who was inspired by the rafflesia flower. The rafflesia doesn\u2019t even grow in South America, but maybe it\u2019s a good thing Plant Man\u2019s design isn\u2019t totally authentic; who would want a Robot Master that smells like rotten meat?! Instead, Plant Man smells as wonderful as the endangered flowers he was built to maintain in Brazil\u2019s botanical gardens. His noble profession and extravagant design engraved Plant Man as a cultural icon of Brazil, and thus won him the Brazilian nomination for the First Annual Robot Master Tournament. Plant Man didn\u2019t have the heart to decline it, but his reluctant acceptance didn\u2019t change the fact he had no weapons to use. In response, Astil equipped Plant Man with the Plant Barrier, an orbiting satellite of petal decorated drones that Plant Man can summon and launch at will. Maybe Plant Man was right to fear this tournament, as he was reprogrammed by Mr. X in a plot to take over the world. After Mega Man defeated and freed the robots of the tournament, Plant Man returned to his gardens, continuing to care for rare and exotic flowers. It's sad, really. Such a talented Robot Master lacks the confidence to pursue any ventures beyond caring for his plants. At least he takes pride in that.",

The result was Tomahawk Man, designed unsubtly after Native American iconography, including an interest in horseback riding; makes you wonder how he and Centaur Man get along. Tomahawk utilizes the Silver Tomahawk, a weapon he wields with both power and precision, reportedly being able to extinguish a candle with the weapon from over three hundred feet away. Being explicitly designed for the tournament, Tomahawk Man doesn\u2019t have much of a relationship with his community or the fellow combatants in the tournament. Maybe that\u2019s why Mr. X was able to reprogram him so easily? Even if he\u2019s a Robot Master of few words, he\u2019s not afraid to get up close and personal with his Silver Tomahawk and Feather Barrage attack. Try to use this lack of personal space against him.",

Hailing from China, Wind Man was originally designed for agricultural duties, firing off razor sharp winds to cut down crops and manipulating the local weather patterns with his 200 mile per hour Wind Storms. Although Wind Man was content with his work, he always secretly longed to demonstrate his Martial Art moves, his favorite past time next to cooking. Fortunately, he was given the chance to do so at the First Annual Robot Master Tournament! Unfortunately, it was secretly an evil scheme masterminded by Mr. X, resulting in Wind Man being reprogrammed and forced to fight Mega Man. Well, at least he still got to show off some cool moves in the process. Don\u2019t let his bulky appearance deceive you: the engines in his feet allow him to zoom across the battlefield astonishingly quick, unleashing jet propelled tackles, kicks, and strikes on his opponents. Do not take this forward approach as a weakness; a great Martial Artist once said, \u201cI fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times\u2026 especially if that man has jet engines in his feet!\u201d",

Built from the start to be a combat robot, Yamato Man commands the Yamato Spear, a javelin like weapon that fires out armor piercing spear tips rather than throwing the whole weapon. His supply is limited, however, so during long fights Yamato Man will have to recollect the spear tips. Fortunately, Yamato Man can keep up with this costly battle tactic thanks to his special armor. His purple plating is only used to deflect weaker attacks, as anything sturdier would weigh Yamato Man down and inhibit his ability to recover the spear tips. It\u2019s unknown why Yamato Man only uses the Yamato Spear, as he is well versed in several martial arts and owns many Japanese swords. Maybe these are more like hobbies than backup combat techniques to Yamato Man, which would make sense seeing how laidback he is. Yamato Man is easygoing and a little on the shy side, living by the same style as his combat: honorably, justly, and calmly. While Yamato Man has always tried to uphold these principles, his belief in them was reinvigorated when he met the chivalrous Knight Man at the First Annual Robot Master Tournament. Yamato Man vowed to redouble his efforts, acting nobly like his newfound friend and inspiration\u2026 while abandoning the overly prideful parts. It\u2019s a wonder this bond even formed, considering Yamato\u2019s distaste for the English language, which Knight Man of course embodies with his representation of the United Kingdom. Maybe even the stoic Yamato Man finds Knight Man\u2019s thespian dialect funny.",

While most ice themed robot masters are perfectly capable of generating extreme colds, none compare to the complete mastering of temperature Freeze Man wields. Turning the laws of thermodynamics on their heads, Freeze Man can split air temperature into highs and lows, using the heat to power himself. The cold gets harnessed and used in combat, his primary weapon being the Freeze Cracker, a projectile shaped like a snowflake that splinters apart upon contact. It might be disingenuous to say this is where most of the cold goes, though. A lot of it just gets wasted on icy props and misty surroundings for Freeze Man\u2019s egotistical entrances. As vain as Freeze Man can be, his dedication to looking cool comes from a desire to entertain as much as it is to impress. Also, it\u2019s not like Freeze Man is incapable of appreciating others, his idolization of Ice Man as the progenitor to freezing Robot Masters and his desire for cleaning pollution standing out as prime examples. Well, maybe the latter of the two is not as selfless as it might seem. After all, how is Freeze Man supposed to look cool with a bunch of junk lying around?",

Taking a page right out of Frankenstein is Junk Man, a hulking mass of spare parts and debris held together by strong electromagnetic forces. Despite his bulky stature, Junk Man was initially created as a resource collection robot, using his grotesque appearance to blend into the piles of trash laying in junkyards, where Junk Man searches for parts Wily can salvage. Junk Man is diligent in this task, having gained quite a knack for valuing pilfered parts on the fly, making the most of his trash heap trips. He isn\u2019t just an errand boy, though. Junk Man is perfectly capable of using all that collected litter in combat, most iconically in the form of the Junk Shield, using scrap metal to shore up his already imposing defenses. The most intact parts end up going to Wily, but ever the efficient worker, Junk Man makes use of any trash he can find, more than happy to attach even the grimiest of scraps to his body. The exception to this rule might be food waste, which never ceases to drive Junk Man up a wall. It\u2019s not that hard guys: food and food contaminated containers, like coffee cups and pizza boxes, can\u2019t be recycled! Do your part so Junk Man can do his.",

Burst Man was supposed to lie dormant in Edo, but being deployed in such a lively city had a formative effect on Burst Man, turning him into a happy-go-lucky Robot Master. Burst Man was giddy to perform at festivals, using the bombs Wily had designed for destructive combat instead as vibrant fireworks. A master at visual pizzazz, Burst Man uses the chemicals in his bubbles to modify his explosives, giving them different colorations and patterns. It\u2019s fortunate he prefers to use his arsenal for leisurely activities, because otherwise he\u2019d be a tricky opponent! His bubbles can coat the battlefield, either bursting to inflict splash damage, or more heinously, confining foes inside of them. In his most dangerous attack, Burst Man fires the Danger Wrap, a bomb encased in a bubble that can trap opponents before exploding, causing more damage due to its proximity. He never uses it to its fullest extent, however, as Burst Man tries to end fights as quickly as possible, fine with winning or losing, just to get back to his festivals. The only thing Burst Man hates more than fighting are extreme temperatures, as high hots and low colds can cause chain reactions in his bombs, ruining the more elaborate displays he has planned. Even if he\u2019s not the best fighter, if you can find him on a temperate summer evening, you\u2019ll be in for a show like no other.",

This roster of Robot Masters had varied responses to being stationed and forced to lie in wait, Cloud Man\u2019s being an almost complete loss of the work ethic he developed in his previous career. The formerly patient Cloud Man became a couch potato and was now only interested in casting harsh thunderstorms, abandoning the variety of weather patterns in his former arsenal. It\u2019s hard to argue with his preference for the raw power of lightning though! His Thunder Bolt attack can inflict some truly wicked damage, given it isn\u2019t redirected by nearby lightning rods. Cloud Man can also summon cloudbursts to halt his opponent\u2019s mobility. It\u2019s a wonder Cloud Man himself isn\u2019t impacted by his strong winds, considering he doesn\u2019t have any legs or feet to anchor him to the ground. Maybe it\u2019s appropriate Cloud Man is the only one capable of weathering these storms, considering his allies don\u2019t want to be around him anyways. Cloud Man makes an insufferable teammate, spending more time in battles pranking his allies or trying to find an easy way out rather than actually fighting. However, if the stars align and Cloud Man finds himself motivated to fight, get ready for a world of hurt.",

Built out of over 2000 springs, Spring Man builds up potential energy with every move he makes, and then unleashes it all on his foes in a destructive showing of kinetic energy. Forget Hooke\u2019s Law, the only hooks Spring Man needs are the ones colliding with the heads of his enemies! He can also unleash the Wild Coil from his buster, but as his arms already make for the perfect ranged weapon, it\u2019s not often he\u2019ll bust that ability out. Unfortunately, his one-of-a-kind design means he\u2019s got a glaring weakness, as pushing his limits might cause his limbs to entangle and snag, leaving him a mess. And Tesla forbid if he were to fight near any stairs! All in all Spring Man\u2019s a carefree individual, the sort of fella to live vicariously through every step and bounce he takes. When he\u2019s particularly elated, he\u2019ll leap and jump as high as he can -- leading to him bumping his head on ceilings pretty often! But regardless, Spring Man\u2019s a joy to watch on any battlefield. Unless that battlefield happens to be on an incline. Then it\u2019s hilarious.",

Wily was particularly interested in Pluto, wondering how he might repurpose, or blatantly steal, their design. Well, they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and if Pluto could see the beast of a Robot Master Slash Man became, maybe he\u2019d be proud. Slash Man is usually stationed in the jungle, where he excels in both construction and combat. His claws are equally good at cutting down trees and climbing up them, where he stalks his prey from the high ground. Once his opponent is spotted, he\u2019ll crash down at blazing speeds and tear into them with the Slash Claw, a swipe of his razor-sharp claws. Most robots don\u2019t consider Slash Man to be a fair fighter, but he doesn\u2019t seem to mind, so long as his tactics keep working. After all, in the jungle, it\u2019s slash or be slashed, crush or be crushed, goop or be gooped! Well, maybe most jungle predators don\u2019t use that last skill, but it seems to work out well for Slash Man. The sticky piles of goop Slash Man rains down on the battlefield trap opponents, allowing him to more easily run them down. The substance seems to be a mix of tar and yolk from the eggs of his dinosaur robot armada, which seems a little morbid, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019d be like having a robot work in a junkya-oh, wait. Anyways, Slash Man is too brash to care about this macabre attack, and is willing to do whatever it takes to finish the hunt.",

It's fitting, then, that Shade Man didn\u2019t even start out as a Robot Master, but as an attraction for an amusement park! After watching one too many Bela Lugosi films, Dr. Wily stole the animatronic and gave it life, turning it into Shade Man. Dr. Wily intended to give Shade Man sound wave emitters that would control the subconscious mind, allowing Wily to captivate the peoples\u2019 hearts through Shade Man. However, after some early wiring frustration, Wily realized it would be much easier to simply amp up the volume and turn Shade Man into a destructive combat robot. After all, what\u2019s easier, spending years infiltrating human governments while keeping up a beguiling alter ego, or to simply threaten them with a weapon able to destroy concrete like a soprano shatters glass? Still wanting to give Shade Man some way of controlling the battlefield, Wily equipped Shade Man petrifying laser optics and a thirst for oil, allowing Shade Man to refuel on the fly\u2026 literally! Arguably the only flaw in Shade Man\u2019s design is his frailty, as any weapon with enough punch can dislodge Shade Man out of the sky. Well, that and his singing voice. Vampires are supposed to be enchanting, but Shade Man\u2019s singing is anything but. Unless maybe you\u2019re a junkyard cat, maybe.",

Wily preserved the beloved vehicle of his youth for decades, making sure to take it for a spin in between world domination schemes. However, when Wily was setting up one of his more masterful plots and needed to throw everything he could at the Blue Bomber, he decided his first mechanical love would make a fitting challenger. Thus, Turbo Man was born, and then promptly beaten by Mega Man; so much for sentimentality. Well, even if he isn\u2019t one of Wily\u2019s strongest Robot Masters, he is one of the fastest. Turbo Man can keep up with and even outpace Quick Man, given he has enough gasoline. Wily managed to optimize Turbo Man\u2019s engine for near immediate acceleration, but this performance is taxing on Turbo Man when used for a prolonged period. Anything more than a quick burst of speed will heat Turbo Man\u2019s engine to the point of catching fire, which he actually uses to his advantage in combat! Besides just ramming into foes, Turbo Man\u2019s weapon of choice is the Scorch Wheel, a flaming wheel of fire that burns the things it touches, generated from his internal body temperature. Considering how recklessly Turbo Man fights, it\u2019s curious he doesn\u2019t catch his own fuel on fire, but this might be because Turbo Man is also equipped to work off electricity. Dr. Wily scrapped the complete transition of Turbo Man\u2019s power source last minute, so rather than using his affinity for electricity to power his attacks or prolong his performance, Turbo Man connected it directly to his stereo. How else is he supposed to blast his victory theme when he wins the Battle and Chase competition for the umpteenth time?",

This Robot Master\u2019s got it all: the power of flight, a diverse arsenal of weaponry, the ability to create typhoons, the experimental evil energy enhancement, an ego second only to his creator, and a Saturday morning cartoon-esque distaste for friendship and unity. Well, Tengu Man\u2019s overconfidence isn\u2019t necessarily misplaced. He masterfully utilizes the Tornado Hold to trap opponents in strong winds and the Tengu Blade, a slash of his Ha-Uchiwa that generates a quick moving shockwave. You\u2019ll only see these moves if he deems you worthy, though. Against most foes, Tengu Man is content to pelt enemies from the high ground, attacking foes just out of reach. He\u2019s a sore loser too, going as far as to join King\u2019s rogue militia just so he could rematch Mega Man. If you thought two defeats at the hand of the Blue Bomber would have mellowed Tengu Man out, you\u2019d be wrong: his arrogance and distaste for personal bonds only grew in an attempt to shore up his damaged ego. He started seeking out new hobbies to dominate others in, but even here Tengu Man found himself struggling. He can beat others in fly fishing, sure, but when Tengu Man started competing in chassis maintenance, he realized how outmatched he was. It doesn\u2019t matter how sharp and pointy he keeps his nose, how would Tengu Man ever beat Flame Man\u2019s prize-winning mustache?",

However, initial analysis showed the evil energy was highly unstable, so rather than just jamming it into a past robot master and risk corrupting one of his prized creations, Wily decided he would insert it into a commercial robot he had previously stolen and repurposed for combat. But how did Wily prevent this first test subject from going on an uncontrollable rampage with its new found alien power? By giving it a cowardly disposition, of course! And thus Astro Man was born, the first evil energy test subject, and a middling success. Astro Man is a gentle giant, his destructive evil energy enhanced firepower locked behind a meek coward with a distaste for direct confrontations and cheap jokes. If he absolutely has to fight, he prefers to do so with powerful attacks that keep his opponents away, like the physically taxing Astro Crush, a volley of meteors that rain down on the battlefield. If you look closely at those meteors, which you should have plenty of time to do as they come hurtling towards you, you may see that they are in the shape of Astro Man himself. Could it be that Astro Man\u2019s weak demeanor is only a facade to hide a dangerous ego? Probably not, considering Astro Man\u2019s history of conceding in fights he clearly would have won. Maybe the Astro Crush is a physically represented form of self hatred, as Astro Man smashes images of his likeness into pieces? This also seems unlikely, as Astro Man would never work up the nerve to so violently confront somebody, even himself. If Astro Man hadn\u2019t been handicapped with his timid personality, it's possible Dr. Wily would have finally triumphed over his blue nemesis. The tin man is supposed to want a heart, but Astro Man\u2019s got too much emotion! Maybe he can talk to Slash Man about getting some courage.",

                "description2": "Dr. Wily is as stubborn as he is brilliant. After stealing a sword with primitive flame emitting technology from the Museum of Robotic Artifacts, Wily realized he had seriously underestimated the weight of the weapon. The robot Wily intended to arm the sword with was much too small to bear the weight of the relic. Two possibilities arose for how to fix this: one, to remake the robot to be bulkier, and two, to simply make his own sword rather than use an outdated curio. Wily decided to do the logical thing and supplement the sword\u2019s weight by implementing an anti-gravitational device separating the robot\u2019s upper and lower halves. Thus, Sword Man\u2019s turbulent development was finally completed and the combat robot master was stationed in Central Asia, guarding the entrance to the subterranean Wily Tower. Despite how ludicrous the anti-gravity device might seem, it ended up working off in spades for Sword Man, who has combined raw strength, agility, and precision in his laigiri inspired fighting style. The Flame Sword is a terrifyingly strong blade in its own right, but its ability to emit flames while being swung makes this blade a weapon with a deceptively long range; if you\u2019re not directly hit by the sword, you\u2019ll still be ignited by the fire it leaves in its wake! Distance fighting won\u2019t work either, as the anti-gravitational device allows Sword Man to easily close the gap, either sending his upper torso forward in a spiraling slash, or launching himself upwards and severing opponents with a descending sword strike. Sword Man knows just how strong he is, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is egotistical about it. The most surprising thing about an already unusual Wily Robot Master might be just how stoic Sword Man is. Sword Man would rather lose a fair fight than cheat a victory, and will even openly commend his opponent\u2019s abilities in combat. This means fighting Sword Man can feel more like a friendly spar than a confrontation of good and evil. However, it\u2019s important you don\u2019t equate this courtesy with him holding back. Sword Man\u2019s fighting with everything he\u2019s got! Whether it\u2019s in the Prototype or in an abandoned volcanic temple, there are two things Sword Man wants you to know. One, he won\u2019t be holding back, so don\u2019t take it personally. Two, don\u2019t bring a chipped blade to your duel. That\u2019d just be disrespectful.",

Haunted Houses are already a niche workspace, so any financial hardships they encounter hit pretty hard. That means it was bad enough when their vampire animatronic was stolen by the infamous Dr. Wily and turned into a combat robot, but for their replacement clown animatronic to suffer the same fate? It seems like Wily might have done it just out of spite anyways, because unlike Shade Man who was just given some combat abilities, Clown Man was originally going to require much more serious enhancements. Clown Man was supposed to be much bigger, possibly acting as an upgraded version of Mash, but Wily ultimately decided to use the hulking robot design for Frost Man instead. This was definitely the right call, as Clown Man\u2019s telescoping arms and light frame allow him to fly across the battlefield, pulling stunts that would make trapeze artists blush! Clown Man has an easy time latching to and swinging around metal objects thanks to the Thunder Claw, an extension of his arms that violently discharge electricity. He\u2019s not afraid to throw his weight around either, bringing a whole new meaning to assault and battery! Don\u2019t expect to hear too many jokes like that from Clown Man himself, however. The manic Robot Master is seldom taken seriously in his more routine activities, so he strives to be respected in combat. He\u2019ll even hurdle insults at you during the fight, and being called \u201cgeeky\u201d has never felt so demoralizing as it does when it comes from a clown. This desire for respect rarely seems to work on the battlefield, however, as even the slightest breeze can cause Clown Man to get tangled up like earphones in a pocket. Still, his electric attacks can devastate unassuming opponents, so try to knock him out as quickly as possible! Well, maybe don\u2019t knock him out cold; Clown Man\u2019s a sleep talker, and you don\u2019t want to hear how you\u2019re faring in his dreams.",

Wily thought giving two distinct personalities would enhance a combat robot\u2019s performance, as their different thought processes and doubled processing speeds would allow them to make the most effective decisions. It\u2019s too bad Wily forgot to actually program a second personality, essentially leaving Search Man a ventriloquist dressed in camo. Perhaps Wily can be forgiven for his absentmindedness, as he was busy experimenting with the extraterrestrial Evil Energy, which Search Man guarded access to by hiding out in the Congo. Here he defended his outpost with all the artillery of a one man army. Er, maybe a two man army\u2026 or would it be a one man and a half army? Either way, Search Man was a tricky opponent for Mega Man, taking potshots at the Blue Bomber with his Homing Sniper, a relentless seeking missile. Search Man has also historically used spiked discs and booby traps on the battlefield, but his most renowned tactic might be his propensity for hiding, which other war robots chastise him for. Maybe if they tried it themselves, they\u2019d see why Search Man manages to maintain such a jovial attitude, because all that time hiding out gives Search Man the opportunity to appreciate the simpler things in life. Unlike other war robots, Search Man gets to stop to smell the roses, staying optimistic in even the harshest battles. He can see the beauty in the world, and is fighting to preserve what he believes is right. Besides, he\u2019d rather be talking to squirrels than his enemies.",

Blizzard Man was somewhat of an exception, with a more annular design, but he was ultimately still a robot made to zoom across the tundra. Dr. Wily decided to amend this by repurposing his scrapped hefty Clown Man chassis into the monstrous Frost Man. This behemoth of a robot is taller than even Stone Man and second only in weight to Hard Man, so his bruiser attitude should come as no surprise. Size isn\u2019t the only thing up Frost Man\u2019s sleeve though. Wily rapidly prototyped more and more advanced cryogenic generators, equipping Frost Man with his final iteration, possibly making Frost Man the coldest of the cold Robot Masters up to that point. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna chip away at his rimy exterior, as Frost Man\u2019s dense armor reflects any attacks that can\u2019t melt through. He\u2019s not afraid to use his chilling might in combat either, capable of unleashing the deceptively quick Ice Wave on his foes. That is, if the punches and body checks don\u2019t work. It\u2019s a good thing Frost Man can send that Ice Wave as fast as he does, as the robot is otherwise pretty slow. The dense armor doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for Frost Man\u2019s oil circulatory system, and the low temperature hinders this even more. Frost Man\u2019s IC chip is also affected by this, meaning Frost Man\u2019s mental prowess matches his complete lack of agility. The giant, while placatable, is anything but gentle, enjoying crushing everything smaller than him\u2026 so basically everything. He crushes buildings and robots like a kid tearing through toy blocks, and is similarly able to be distracted by popsicles and kakigori. This outright oafish nature of Frost Man makes his immaculate ice sculpting skills all the more surprising. Maybe that slow mobility gives Frost Man a steadier hand for the precise craft? Or maybe he\u2019s just too stupid to realize it\u2019s boring and he\u2019d rather be doing something else.",

An exception to this is Grenade Man, whose Flash Bombs were the first thing Dr. Wily developed. Wily invented the Flash Bomb while tinkering with some of his past robot masters, creating a new explosive with a much larger blast radius and a longer lasting detonation. However, this came at the price of greatly shortening the fuse of the bombs, meaning even his quickest Robot Masters who fired the Flash Bomb couldn\u2019t outrun the resulting explosion. Wily decided he would need to create an all new Robot Master with two special traits to wield this weapon, the first being an explosion resistant suit of armor, and the second being a reckless personality bordering on masochism. This meant not only would Grenade Man be capable of tanking his own explosions, but he wants to too! The Flash Bomb is not the only weapon Grenade Man wields, however. The Crazy Destroyer is a fury of highly terrain damaging mines Grenade Man spreads across the arena, leaving only rubble in their wake. You\u2019d think these two types of explosives would make Grenade Man a highly strategic fighter, commanding control of the battlefield. You would be wrong; Grenade Man doesn\u2019t have a strategic circuit in his body, only acting on instinct and impulse. He\u2019s more likely to crash himself into his opponents than he is to lay a trap. Heck, Mega Man wouldn\u2019t have discovered Grenade Man\u2019s takeover of an Argentinian artillery factory so quickly if the mad Robot Master wasn\u2019t making such a ruckus over testing their weapons on himself. Wily\u2019s robots have a history of displaying manic personalities, but Grenade Man might be the first one to be certifiably insane. Until someone makes Psychiatry Man to give a proper diagnosis, Grenade Man will just have to treat himself the only way he knows how: dynamite massages and napalm spas.",

                "description2": "Aquatic robots tend to be the archetype Dr. Wily defaults to when he needs a final robot master to round out a set of new creations. Wily always tries to find some aspect that can make his robots unique though, so when looking at his past marine Robot Masters, he realized they were all designed to work while fully submerged. This inspired Wily to steal a waterworks robot and create Aqua Man, a Robot Master that brings the water with him, able to unleash aquatic onslaughts even in the most arid of battlefields. Aqua Man isn\u2019t conservative with his limited supplies of water either, creating giant geysers and firing the Water Balloon, a frankly wasteful flurry of watery projectiles. However, his most impressive technique might be the Water Cannon, a column of water Aqua Man can redirect during while the attack is still being fired. How on earth is this possible, you might be asking; perhaps the water is chilled to the point of nearly being solid, so Aqua Man is controlling nearly solid slush rather than water? That would make sense considering Dr. Wily used leftover parts from Frost Man in his modifications of Aqua Man. Then again, Frost Man himself was made with leftover parts from Clown Man, so did any of those find their way into Aqua Man? Maybe the joke telling circuit did, but it must have gotten fried at some point, because Aqua Man\u2019s crass humor makes even Cut Man groan. Aqua Man makes for awful company in general, his childlike temperament and toilet jokes driving most robots mad. Imagine how excited poor Wave Man must have been to discover Wily had created a robot that used to work in water treatment, only to be met with a robot making fart noises and leaving his lunch scraps everywhere. It was then Aqua Man\u2019s weakness to blunt force attacks was discovered. You might be able to crack his tanks with a hard-enough blow, meaning he\u2019ll lose all stored water he attacks with, but more importantly, you might get him to take a hint and shut up.",

                "description2": "Robots have turned villainous for many reasons in 20XX. Some were created for the express purpose of causing destruction, while others were coerced into antagonism, be it by reprogramming, blackmail, or viral infections. But what about the robots that willingly chose to betray their creators? Do they revel in their villany, or do they have regrets? Dynamo Man, who was formerly a mild mannered tour guide robot, had approached King after hearing rumors about sermons of \u201crobot independence,\u201d wanting to learn how to better assert himself. He had so much to share with the museum patrons, but his speeches often fell on the deft ears of disinterested guests. Instead, Dynamo was radicalized and weaponized by the silver-tongued King, and sent back to the power plant on reconnaissance, gaining information on the nearby city\u2019s power consumption. The personality matrix of Dynamo Man was not designed to work in his newly generated electromagnetic fields, and Dynamo Man consequently became unstable. The visitors who formerly treated Dynamo Man with apathy became fearful and distant. Dynamo Man was enraged at this ostracization, growing a distaste for humanity and fully enlisting in King\u2019s militia, becoming a devastating foe when fought under the right conditions. Dynamo Man\u2019s power output is unmatched by any other robot master, demonstrated in his wicked Dynamo Bolt, strikes of lightning capable of shocking even the most insulated targets. However, the Dynamo Bolt is the only attack Dynamo can use on his own, and it is very taxing on his internal storage. What really makes Dynamo Man a deadly combatant is his gadgetry. In his quarters, Dynamo Man can volley small dynamos that continuously discharge electricity at his foes or can hop into a recharge station to rapidly fill his batteries. You\u2019d think this equipment would have been left in the real world, but it seems they were somehow digitized alongside Dynamo Man. He\u2019s certainly a tough robot master to take down, and that\u2019s assuming he stays down; how many more times is he going to get back up? Dynamo Man is a robot that could more easily be pacified with compassion instead of violence, but the Prototype will allow no such peaceful fate.",

                "description2": "Some of Dr. Wily\u2019s schemes are so maniacal that they just sound goofy. Threatening to make robotic dinosaur hybrids might sound scary to an elementary school student, but not to the world populace who has seen your world domination schemes fail countless times. Wily seemed to have realized this as well, and the project only got as far as stealing a refrigerator holding dinosaur DNA from Light Labs. The fridge collected dust in storage until being rediscovered by King, who saw value in any electronic device, even one without consciousness. So, after tossing aside the vials of dinosaur DNA worth billions, King set about turning the discount fridge into a combat robot master. The first modification was cranking Cold Man\u2019s temperature from a toasty negative eighty degrees Celsius to near absolute zero. Cold Man uses this chilling cold to freeze the very air around him, generating the Ice Wall, a tumbling column of ice that can be launched at his foes. This had the unfortunate side effect of slowing down all of Cold Man\u2019s functions, as the closer it is to absolute zero, the less particles move. To accommodate this, King deliberately designed a boring personality for Cold Man. It meant Cold Man was uninvested in his new life, but it was better to be consistent in mundanity than inconsistent in delicate tasks. It\u2019s important to note that Cold Man isn\u2019t dumb; far from it, Cold Man is quite efficient at what he does, he just doesn\u2019t care about doing it; apathy is separate from intelligence. There is no passion to his fight, but Cold Man can still be a dangerous opponent! The only thing that can really motivate Cold Man are sweets, which is a bit odd considering he has no mouth and also is a robot. That doesn\u2019t stop Cold Man from picking up a Frappuccino on his way into work every day and some shaved ice on his way back home. Maybe he just likes storing them inside of him, nostalgic for his days as a refrigerator?",

After all, it\u2019s hard to make a reliable chain of command when a requirement for the robots you're recruiting is the willingness to shirk their responsibilities. No, King would need a reliable ally to give the most important task of the revolution: to collect a ludicrous amount of wealth. Afterall, what is a king with no treasure hoard? Thus, Ground Man was created and immediately sent off to raid ruins for their riches. Ground Man\u2019s quick work of these ruins is actually what tipped off much of the world to King\u2019s militia forming, as nobody recognized the rogue Robot Master who was plundering these relics. And plunder he did, largely thanks to the Spread Drill, a versatile mining tool that doubled as a weapon in his climactic fight with Mega Man and Bass. The device can remotely split apart into smaller drills, allowing it to cover a greater surface area. However, it would be misleading to suggest this is all Ground Man can do. He can transform into a vehicle sporting a gigantic drill blade, cruising through rock as if it was sand! Not actual sand though, as that would have quite the opposite effect. Ground Man is always moaning about how bogged down he gets in the stuff, it filling up all his servos. Ground Man is a bit of stick in the mud in general, always focused on the task at hand. He\u2019ll be more than willing to discuss the job and how best to do it, he\u2019s just unwilling to talk about anything else. Anything besides his own collection of valuables, that is. Ground Man started skimming the plundered loot he was collecting, taking small enough portions that he assumed no one would notice. King did notice, but he simply didn\u2019t care, as it just meant Ground Man worked even harder to find more treasure to replace the trinkets he kept!",

                "description2": "Ground Man was created to acquire King a treasure hoard, and he did so with aplomb, barring one small exception that you can probably guess: Ground Man can\u2019t swim. To fund his rebellion to the fullest, King would need a robot that could scour the sea for treasure as easily as Ground Man did on land. And what would be a more fitting moniker than Pirate Man, modeled after an old-timey privateer? Decked out with a tricorne, an eyepatch, and a hooked hand, Pirate Man is just shy of a peg leg to be the perfect buccaneer stereotype! That hook hand isn\u2019t the only weapon at his disposal though. Pirate Man is a master of the two elements you\u2019d think a pirate ought to be: water and explosives! Pirate Man can drain and fill his environment as he needs, and when he\u2019s got enough water to go buoyant, he\u2019ll encase himself in a bubble and rush down his enemies. It might not sound strategic, but that\u2019s just true to history. Pirates ruled by brute force, not strategy! However, if a more tactical weapon is warranted, Pirate Man isn\u2019t afraid to throw out the Remote Mine, an explosive with a seemingly endless fuse, able to lie in wait until remotely detonated by the user. Why would you need a bomb with that much delay? Maybe Pirate Man secretly planted them on ships he intended to raid and waited for them to enter international waters before striking. Pirate Man probably needed to be this devious to get a fraction of the wealth Ground Man did, as Dive Man was constantly on his tracks, trying to put a stop to his thievery. You almost feel bad for Pirate Man, cause it seems like Dive Man was specifically made to stop the kind of shenanigans Pirate Man was made for, and Dive Man was made first! It's no wonder he seems so stressed, being found downing drinks at the oil bar whenever he isn't at sea. He tried for a while to leave the oil out before drinking it, hoping to make its effects more potent, but he eventually discovered oil fermentation doesn't work like that.",

King deceived him in order to accomplish this, telling him that he was primed to self-destruct unless he burned down every forest in the world.  His signature weapon, the Wave Burner, shoots a continuous stream of intense flame from the flamethrower on his right hand.  As a result of his being lied to, Burner Man is incredibly high-strung, focusing intensely, almost completely, on his objective of burning everything in sight.  Between his dangerous weapon and his borderline-insane nature, Burner Man is dangerous, making even Crash Man's explosive rage seem sane. If one day, he learns about King's lies about him self-destructing by not burning, would he really stop incinerating nature?",

However, after a while, Magic Man got sick of the same old acts and decided the best way to spruce up his life was to employ in King's army, calling it a new source of entertainment. At first, King was doubtful in employing Magic Man, but after he saw the \"Magic Card\", a weapon that could sap energy from the target to boost Magic Man's power, King gave him a high position in his corps. Magic Man also uses quite a bit of illusions to confuse his opponents, another factor that led to his high position. Magic Man happens to love the sound of applause, being a bit of an attention-seeker, and he employs the \"Magician never tells his secrets\" philosophy well, although this had led to him being a bit of a shady robot. He also has incredibly bad timing, even when he spends long periods of time perfecting a trick. He's also good friends with Crystal Man. It's hard to tell when Magic Man is throwing either tricks or the real deal, but pay attention and show him the trick you have up your sleeve!",

Concrete Man is known for being incredibly stubborn and will tell off any and all lazy robots or humans in the workplace. He's also good friends with Guts Man, fitting as they both have an extremely similar design. Concrete Man's main weapon in battle is the Concrete Shot, which will immobilize the enemy if they are hit. He's also incredibly strong, another trait he shares with Guts Man, but there is an attack out there that can penetrate his shielding.

While Tornado Man was apart of the robot revolt, he made cyclones from the air current to both carry him around and to launch at opponents, lifting both them and small objects and platforms skyward. His Tornado Blow in specific was able to create several cyclones around him to carry opposing robots up and letting them crash down to the ground. Out of his Robot Master line, Tornado Man is always one, if not the most level-headed of his group and has the most leading qualities, despite the head-in-the-cloud jokes he always receives.

Along with the rest of her Robot Master line, Splash Woman was tricked by Dr. Wily into getting reprogrammed and designed for combat. Her Laser Trident has originally been made for cutting through ship hulls, but Dr. Wily adapted the ability into a projectile, which she shoots from her trident. Splash Woman also leads a school of robotic fish into combat, which she activates by singing, which the fishes' audio sensors pick up on. Although her attacks deal heavy damage, she is frail to attacks, so she prefers to take her opponents out from afar. Despite her fighting skills, she went back to her rescue missions after Mega Man defeated Wily yet again. If she's not out at sea, she can often be found in a sea-side karaoke bar, practicing her singing. Now, if only Dr. Light would give her some normal legs so she could try visiting other karaoke bars....",

He was designed to test the quality control in a television factory, although he's more notably known for being an unwilling facet in Dr. Wily's expiration date plot. Plug Man's main weapon is the Plug Ball, a small, round electric-based ball that can scurry on surfaces that aren't even conductive! Yet, despite his electrical capabilities, Plug Man simply doesn't have the heart of a fighter compared to his electrical counterpart, Elec Man; he's certainly much more into the casual aspects of life in Mega City. He's obsessed with electronic stores, and an connoisseur of various shonen and slice-of-life animes. He's also not afraid about talking with his friends about geeky subjects, and he also seems to be good friends with Bright Man. Despite being a bit odd, he's an incredibly nice person to know and chat with. And, if you likely ask him nicely enough, he'd probably be willing to power your TV for you!",

Although he isn't quite an offensive fighter, nor would he ever want to be, his Jewel Barrier manages to keep any opponents or attacks out of his range. That's right, he's using priceless diamonds to defend himself from attacks! Jewel Man's eye is never fixated too long on the battle though, as his eyes are naturally more attentive to the finer things in life. True to his name, Jewel Man is obsessed with bejeweled trinkets and ornaments. No, really, it's actually a genuine problem. Jewel Man ended up snatching Dr. Light's credit card and expending cash towards particularly priceless pieces of jewelry, causing the Light family to hold their first ever family intervention. It'd be nicely saccharine to pretend that Jewel Man has now sworn off his jewel temptations, but in reality all it means is that he's just more discreet in his money-mooching attempts... Anyways, back on topic, Jewel Man's able to be fortified in battle with the simple snap of his fingers. However, if one were to apply enough pressure, it's possible to get Jewel Man to crack!",

Taking inspiration from nature's most efficient and well-working specimens, the bees, Hornet Man was to pollinate the flowers of a large park nearby the Light household and overall aid the dying bee population. The Hornet Chaser was used for widespread care of plants, but Hornet Man modified them for more offensive strategies as well, helping when he served the role as opposition against Mega Man. Hornet Man is practically a database of ways to take care of gardens, making him an expert at what he does. He spends most of his time gardening if you weren't sure, and even allows Beat to fly through and help him out. But, due to his dedicated passion of urban planning, Hornet Man's schedule is filled to the brim with responsibility; it's been rumored that he's never used a single vacation day in all his days of service! As far as micro-managers go, Hornet Man definitely lies in the upper echelon!",

His main weapon, Magma Bazooka, was based on Atomic Fire, a flame-based attack that can be charged up for more power. The stronger the charge, the stronger the flame! However, generally just staying around him in battle is incredibly dangerous, as he's constantly generating heat to attack his enemies with, leaving teammates struggling to not get hit themselves. Magma Man's material is specifically designed to withstand him from high temperatures, although it isn't designed to assist him in cold areas. He's a bit of a rowdy fellow, but ultimately he's often reserved. This makes him a bit unpredictable, as one second he could be as calm as a feather and the next, he's fiercer than ever. He also likes to visit the local hot spa after work, relaxing in the warm waters. Magma Man's generally not too rough in battle and won't bother you, but if he's getting ready to explode with the power of Magma Bazooka, there might not be any hope....",

His main weapon, Black Hole Bomb, was designed to clear nearby meteors that would put any stations in impending danger. He can also retract his arms and legs to soar short distances, stereotypical UFO style. He's an extremely intelligent robot, and in his free time, he likes providing calculations for the trajectory of rockets. However, if he's ever proved wrong about a calculation, he'll quickly change the answer and claim he was only \"testing your knowledge.\" Recently, Galaxy Man and his fellow co-workers have noticed strange signals from space, but have dismissed it as of now, although they haven't kept it out of their minds. Galaxy Man is a knowledgeable fellow, and he prefers to use brain over brawn in his battles. He predicts and calculates every possible outcome, making him a dangerously intelligent foe to face.",

                "description2": "For many years, Blade Man served dutifully as the cutting-edge guide and guardian at a historic castle site. The current lord of the castle, by all accounts a reported fanatic of all things swordsmanship-related, had Blade Man built in order to elegantly fuse the practices of the past with the many refinements afforded by the future. This luxurious background gave Blade Man the opportunity to truly fall in love with the sharp art of armaments, delivering him his purpose and drive in life. Unfortunately, during the Roboenza epidemic, Blade Man became one of the earliest documented cases, and in his sickened frenzy overtook and ravaged the castle he was meant to safeguard. Despite not necessarily being designed for combat, as a robot whose hands could carve a turkey in two, it wasn\u2019t particularly hard for him to adapt; Blade Man used his acute appendages to rapidly cover ground all over the castle. Of course, he was also quite knowledgeable in sword-fighting and in performance impalement arts, which was terrifying when paired with his signature Triple Blade ability, a volley of piercing miniature blades. Blade Man was eventually quelled, cured, and allowed to return to work, though not without a lot of legal contention from the World Robot Union, who contested the safety of Blade Man\u2019s design in a workplace setting. He was only somewhat dubiously cleared after the castle lord argued that Blade Man\u2019s mania was technically historically significant to the castle, and he needed to be maintained as an important figure to the site. This was a joy for Blade Man anyway, as he could return to lecturing tourists and sightseers once again to his heart\u2019s content; Blade Man\u2019s known to be a bit of a nerd when it comes to swords, and his passionate ramblings have confused and lost many jetlagged travelers. Just don\u2019t get him started when it comes to new-era technology weapons like the busters \u2013 he\u2019ll tell you all about how a proper gentleman would never use those! When it comes time to fight, don\u2019t think he\u2019s dumb in bringing a sword to a gunfight; otherwise, you\u2019ll be the one picking up the pieces!",

In his malfunctioning state, he attacked the world under Dr. Wily's control, using large water droplets as a shield. The Water Shield sounds bad in idea only, it's actually one of the more effective and interesting shield attacks out there! He relocated his base to a sewer beneath a heavily-populated city, but Mega Man and friends eventually confronted him there, defeating him in the process. Afterwards, Pump Man's life went back to normal, but it also gave him a chance to meet his favorite fellow Water Robot Master, Splash Woman. Pump Man is a bit obsessed with cleanliness, and is known to be a bit of a clean-freak. He washes things two times over, fearing all the germs that life holds. He also started a program to wash off graffiti in his local neighborhood, and it's gone well. Pump Man has a disliking for Oil Man, the slick oil Robot Master. Make fun of him all you want for his habits, but he'll clean that smirk off your face! Rightfully so, as he has no clue how many germs smiles could give!",

He's a bit of a drill-sergeant type robot, giving direct orders he expects his men to follow. It's his way or the highway! He never gives up in a battle unless absolutely necessary, and will always continue fighting, no matter the costs! All that matters is that he can taste victory at the end! He also has a disliking for renegades, and very well considers them the bane of his existence. This guy's all orders, but if you feel like disagreeing with him, it's all fine.

Chill Man is a robot that was made to aid in stopping global warming and help recruit others by showing them the beauty of nature. However, while under Dr. Wily's control, his normal cooling systems were converted into weapon form, creating the Chill Spike. If the Chill Spike shot comes into direct contact with the enemy, they will be frozen in place and wide open to attacks. However, if the Chill Spike makes contact with the floor, the ice forms into the shape of 3 cone-like spikes, which can interrupt attacks and cause damage to anyone who happens to run into it. After the Roboenza incident, Chill Man was able to return to his arctic natural observation job and has found photography to be a better way of freezing a moment in time. It may seem odd for a robot to be this concerned with the environment, but Chill Man has become quite popular online for his stunning photographs of arctic life. Just try not to act too coldly to this robot; it gets lonely in a below-zero environment, you know?",

His signature weapon, Thunder Wool, is as every bit as unique as he is, where he creates a cloud made of pure wool to zap the opponent from above! He can also transform his material form into clouds of wool, an adjustment made by Dr. Wily when Sheep Man was infected with Roboenza. Speaking of, Dr. Wily was first unimpressed with Sheep Man, and decided not to use him in his operations, until Sheep Man showed off his electrifying qualities, and Wily gained confidence that Sheep Man would provide a fight against Mega Man. In his spare time, he volunteers at a circuit board manufacturer, testing static resistance and such. However, he easily gets bored of things and can fall asleep quite easily. He's also aware that his design is a bit ridiculous, but he'd rather take a nap than worry about such things. Speaking of sheep, since people dream of sheep jumping fence, what exactly does Sheep Man dream of? In fact, do robots even dream?",

He was especially skilled at throwing fast balls, his top speed clocking in at 121.6 mph, a whole 16.5 mph faster then the human world record equivalent. When Dr. Wily released his Roboenza on the world, Strike Man was one of the robots to fall ill, causing him to malfunction. While under Wily's control, his normal pitching abilities were updated to allow him to calculate rebound pitches. He was given the weapon Rebound Striker for fighting Mega Man. He can also launch himself into opponents, tackling them with his whole body. After the Roboenza incident, Strike Man spent several years re-perfecting his pitch. He's been put back on the Mega City Tigers, but only to pitch; whenever he goes to bat, the ball goes into orbit. If you're ever at bat with Strike Man pitching, you definitely do not want to lean into his pitches to score a free walk.",

                "description2": "Chances are, even if you don\u2019t realize it, you might recognize this Robot Master; for years, Nitro Man has served as a stunt double for some of 20XX\u2019s biggest action stars, none more famous than his legendary motorcycle chase scene in Upgrade Impossible III. A red streak star, he was born to thrill \u2013 literally, of course, given that his chassis is outfitted with a permutable wheel set-up and makeshift engine. He even has little handlebars to steer! Eventually, at some point, Nitro Man wanted to step up his stunt game \u2013 so he had the stunt department outfit him with his Wheel Cutter ability to let him pull off some really cool wall-climbing stunts! It\u2019s easy to gleam, but Nitro Man\u2019s a full-blown daredevil. It doesn\u2019t matter the feat, you can count on Nitro Man being the one to put his neck out and get that take. Granted, given he\u2019s a robot, any death-defying stunt just lands him in the mechanic\u2019s for a week\u2026 but it does make it tough to get insured! Notably, Nitro Man is also the acting president of a robot stunt club running sixty members strong. Just recently, they\u2019d been campaigning for stronger union guarantees and more paid sick days after Nitro Man had been let go on Roboenza-leave. His attitude to battle is the same as his stunts; hit the throttle and don\u2019t look back! His safety comes last! And unfortunately, yours probably does too.",

However, when he was inflicted with Roboenza, he used his \"Solar Blaze\" attack for more nefarious purposes, using his stored energy to cause major damage. He focuses more on keeping his enemies away with fiery attacks, and isn't much of a close-range fighter, as he wasn't built with any close attacks of the sort. Solar Man is a bit of a health-nut, and dislikes cloudy days. Despite being a robot, he is mindful of what he eats and prefers eating grown products. He also developed a \"Solar Workout\" plan, and with some refinement that he learned from his time as a robot of evil, it became a bit of a trend across the country. The workout itself is fairly simple, although intense, and borrows inspiration from the sun itself. Solar Man works out quite often, and his attacks are no solar flare, so keep an eye on this guy! Don't stare at him too long when he's pumped for battle though, or you might hurt your eyes!",

This intent is nowhere else more highlighted than in Block Man's Block Dropper, which generates weighty stone blocks to be plunged straight down from the air. Despite it seeming amateurish and simplistic in motion, this technique does genuinely require quite a bit of care and precision to avoid any accidental aching head injuries. And on that front, Block Man is, well... he's not spotless. Nevertheless, despite his short and stout physique, Block Man's filled to the brim with energy, even if this is primarily to serve his own ambition. See, it's his dream to one day create a vast system of structures inspired by temples and pyramids of old, preferably with his face adorned somewhere to let people know the craftsman. In that sense, he's admittedly rather vain and thick as a brick, and even with his cement attire, insults can crumble his temperament with ease. Still, he's close friends with fellow Nakaume robot Impact Man, and really, there's not a work of architecture out there that can weather the elements better than a strong friendship! Well, not literally that is; then Block Man's handiwork prevails.",

Don't let that fool you; it'd be erroneous to classify him as a mere Elec Man rip-off, as while Elec Man actively manipulates the flow of electricity, Fuse Man travels alongside it to efficiently fine tune any power transformers. As one may imagine, this makes Fuse Man unbelievably fast, rivaling the speed of a lightning bolt as his body condenses beyond mere matter to become pure energy! And, if his speed doesn't do the trick, his \"Scramble Thunder\" releases mild bolts of electricity to cover even further ground. While this method is certainly admirable, it is not without its flaws; channeling currents excessively or improperly will cause him to short circuit, and thus his fuses will preemptively blow to avoid a potential critical overload. As such, Fuse Man can never afford to be capricious, as his sense of responsibility will dictate either a city's pleasantly leisure or its catastrophic blackout. Of course, being on edge 24\/7 is exceedingly stressful even for tireless robots, so he comes up with silly puns to discharge any anxiety. Yet, he's always fully charged mentally after he's gotten to tend to his dear pet rabbit, \"Watt.\" You'd think that something like an electrical eel would fit his tastes more thematically, but chances are his rabbit probably just makes him feel more comfortable about his over-the-top headgear....",

Manufactured by the B.B Bomb Company not for excavation but as a pyrotechnician, Blast Man provides practical effects from the smallest of bangs to cataclysmic bangs for some of the most established movie sets and theme parks in the world. His understanding of the importance of timing when it comes to explosions is also profound, and this makes him a whiz with his signature Chain Blast ability, a series of timed sticky bombs that, when detonated together, adds a wholly-inspired flourish of visual wonder! Any who know him would say that Blast Man may be volatile, unstable, and too easily excited, and while they\u2019re completely right about that, underneath the crazy hair and cobalt blue armor is the heart of an explosion artist. Blast Man has such a blazing passion for incendiary bursts that he even pens a serial column in his favorite magazine, Boom Monthly. And more than anything, Blast Man seeks to fulfill his life-long aspiration of creating \u2018Blast Man Adventure\u2019, an awe-inspiring, death-defying thrill-ride that\u2019ll render even the hardiest of thrill-seekers blown away! Of course, despite being an artist, Blast Man\u2019s chaotic gracefulness is also a major asset in the battlefield, and can only be aptly described as\u2026. Well, to quote Blast Man\u2019s own writing, \u201cfreakin\u2019 awesome. Ka-boom. Ka-blam. Pow.\u201d",

Manufactured by the Mecha-Chucets Institute of Robology, Acid Man's so comfortable with acerbic properties that he has tubes upon tubes of who-knows-whats constantly coursing through his body like a bloodstream.   And for practicality in the plant, Acid Man's buster is specially designed to easily expel those chemicals -- though this gives him an obvious edge in combat as well. Not only can he fire biting globs in rapid succession, but he has such high chemical mastery that he can enclose himself in a barrier of corrosive acid that'll keep even the most courageous of robots at bay. Of course, you couldn't do the mad chemical mixer any justice without mentioning his impeccable swimming prowess. As a byproduct of a cutting-edge hydrodynamic design, Acid Man will gladly take a graceful dive into the plant's chemical tanks and swim worry-free as he ensures that the tanks' measurements stay true to his high standards. This habit has led the plant's human workers to give him the sobriquet of \"the Acid Merman\", a nickname Acid Man so vehemently detests. And on the topic of detest, the only thing Acid Man detests more is sloppy work; he's well-known for being an utter perfectionist in the workplace, one that doesn't shy away from throwing tantrums when chemicals aren't measured out to his exact expectations. This may give one the impression that Acid Man is only a mad scientist gone too far, but is it really so 'mad' to have a passion that burns with such bright joy that you're literally named after what you love?... If it's highly corrosive acid, then yes, probably.",

Inspired by the humans who could make the ice their dance floor, this robot challenged the notions of their creation and began to make modifications to become gracile and graceful, transforming into the Robot Master we now know as Tundra Man. Though designed by Dr. Cossack to monitor drastic environmental changes and develop land in the coldest climates of Earth, Tundra Man\u2019s love of ice skating quickly took over and encouraged him to put on the skates, making him far faster than Cossack had ever originally intended! Tundra Man\u2019s so fast, in fact, that his triple axel is capable of producing a numbing funnel of subzero winds! But, combat is never his first priority; skating is his raison d'\u00eatre, and if he happens to bump into anyone while doing so, so be it. He\u2019s flashy, dramatic, but most of all!.... He\u2019s really rather lonely. With an audience of mainly huskies, polar bears, and seals, Tundra Man yearns for the day for when he can display his dazzling  footwork to the same grand stage that had inspired him so many years ago! For now, styling on his opponents during combat will have to do.",

Working as an outdoors advisor as a product of Tsubakuro Precision Machining, Torch Man delights in teaching others on how only they can prevent forest fires. Though one would suspect Torch Man and his safety hazard shoulders would be ill-fitting in a densely shrubbed area, he actually undergoes a strict training regiment to keep his heat under self-control; yet in moments where he becomes especially emblazoned, he can unleash spiraling infernos that soar and crash into the ground below! While impressive, it has little use in camping circumstances, so Torch Man dedicates himself to practicing martial arts daily to keep the fire burning within him tempered. Aside from being adept in the Shotokan and Aikido styles, Torch Man also started his own form of martial arts, \u2018Torch-jutsu\u2019, centered around strong self-discipline and jumping kicks. But despite his regiments, he can\u2019t help but afford to lapse when he emotionally flares up, like the time he crisped the camp dinner during a particularly invigorating turkey roast. As such, Torch Man still walks the long and harrowing road of self-improvement, never stopping, never faltering, until the day he can keep his searing spirit in check. His latest step in training, for example, was to stand under the calming pressure of a raging waterfall. The subsequent repairs took three months\u2026.",

Though he certainly gives off the appearance of a sturdy construction robot, Impact Man is actually comprised of three separate pile driver robots, collectively known as the Impact Brothers. The separating is certainly helpful when it comes to cover the most ground in piling endeavors, but for the most part, it\u2019s only when the three brothers work together in an unified effort that they can make great strides in their work. And great strides do they make; beyond his sturdy frame, one may notice Impact Man\u2019s signature piling equipment functioning as his ligaments, and utilizing his strong acceleration can he make a great impact on dense foundation walls. And due to his segmented design, he can handily morph his form to whatever the situation requires! As Impact Man, he is nothing short of diligent, a worker who never hesitates to completing the task in record time. As individual siblings however, the personalities\u2026 begin to vary: Kui-ichiro, the oldest, takes lead control, but the efficient youngest sibling, Kui-saburo, often substitutes in. On the other hand, the middle sibling, Kui-jiro, is awfully disorderly and thus can\u2019t be trusted to take the reins. But though the brothers may quarrel from time to time, ultimately they\u2019ll always defend each other from any slight and push through when the job\u2019s on the line!

Now with Bounce Man as evidence, the answer to that question is a resounding \u2018yes!\u2019 Originally developed by Joint R&D to work as a recyclable crash test robot, his phenomenal elasticity and resilience bestowed him a position at \u2018Boing Boing Park\u2019, an indoor athletics facility meant to teach children the importance of exercise. Given the proper momentum, Bounce Man with his hefty stature can bounce and fling around rooms like a rubber ball that just won\u2019t stop, making him an unintentional nuisance to the people around him! His elastic jab makes for a heck of a punch, and he can even toss out more bouncy balls to crowd out the room with. All this would make Bounce Man one of the toughest Robot Masters out there, but due to his childlike demeanor, combat\u2019s just one big silly game to him! Innocence and optimism abound emanate from his joyous disposition, and kids go crazy for his funny looks and big, round body. He\u2019s also surprisingly popular among middle-aged women due to his \u2018Hopxercise\u201d program -- it\u2019s like boxing, but on trampolines. All in all, Bounce Man\u2019s jocular reputation have made him and Boing Boing Park a household name for all who enjoy the act of bouncing. Thus, it is no wonder to see how Bounce Man can be so carefree and riddled with positive energy! Actually, there is one thing that gets him down in the dumps\u2026 the stairs!",

Blossom Woman would have served a similar purpose to Plant Man, but would have also been able to communicate with both plant and insect life. This concept was later revisited by Dr. Light in his design for a \"Honey Woman,\" which eventually became Hornet Man. Naturally, Blossom Woman's design seems to be based off both a flower and possibly a praying mantis or similar insect.",
